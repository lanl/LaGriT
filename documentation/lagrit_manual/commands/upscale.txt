.. _upscale:

##  UPSCALE

> The **upscale** command is used to interpolate attribute values from nodes
of a fine source mesh to node attributes of a coarse sink mesh. The subroutine
finds nodes of the fine source mesh within the Voronoi cell of every node in
the coarser sink mesh. Nodes on cell boundaries are assigned to two or more
sink nodes. Then the attributes of all the source nodes within a source node's
cell are upscaled into a single value based on the chosen method. Mesh
elements and connectivity are ignored and only node values are used to upscale
values on to the sink mesh nodes.

A kdtree node search is used to find the source mesh nodes located in each of
the Voronoi sink point volumes. It is possible for source nodes to occur on
the boundary of multiple Voronoi volumes. By default, all nodes found in each
Voronoi volume are used to upscale to the enclosed sink node. In this case,
source nodes on multiple Voronoi boundaries will be included in upscale
calculations more than once. The keyword option **single** can be used for
situations that require the sum of nodes in each Voronoi space to equal the
total of source points used. This one-to-one correspondence is written to the
source cmo attribute pt_gtg. This attribute can be reused during multiple
calls to the **upscale** command and will greatly reduce CPU time. The keyword
that allows the attributes to be kept as part of the sink cmo is **keepatt**.
Note that information regarding duplicate nodes on Voronoi volume boundaries
will be lost if the pt_gtg is used instead of the default search.

>

> The **upscale** method options provide choices for the calculation of the
associated set of source nodes on to the single sink node. The scale_method
parameter includes **sum**, **min**, **max**, and averages **ariave**,
**harave**, **geoave**. For all positive data sets containing at least one
pair of nonequal values, the harmonic mean is always the least of the three
means, while the arithmetic mean is always the greatest of the three and the
geometric mean is always in between.

>> The format for the command line is as follows:

**upscale **/ scale_method / cmosink, attsink / 1,0,0 / cmosrc, attsrc /  
[boundary_choice] [keepatt] [set_id]

Keywords appearing after the source cmo attribute name are optional and may
appear in any order.

  
  
scale_method is the choice of upscale calculation applied to each set of
source nodes within each sink Voronoi cell where x(1) to x(n) are the values
of source nodes 1 to n found for the sink point. The choices are as follows:

>>

>>>

**ariave** - For each sink point, calculate the arithmetic mean of n values from source attribute  attsrc    
sink_val = (x(1) + x(i)... + x(n)) / n

for 4 values; 1,2,3,4 ariave = 2.5

  
**geoave** - For each sink point, calculate the geometric average of n values found in  attsrc    
sink_val = ( x(1) * x(i)... * x(n) )**(1/n)

for 4 values; 1,2,3,4 geoave = 2.21336

  
**harave** - For each sink point, calculate the harmonic mean of n values from source attribute  attsrc    
sink_val = n / ( 1/x(1) + 1/x(i)... + 1/x(n) )

for 4 values; 1,2,3,4 harave = 1.92

  
**min** or **max** - For each sink point, assign the min or max source attribute from n values found in  attsrc    
sink_val = min(x(1),x(i),x(n))

for 4 values; 1,2,3,4 min = 1

  
sink_val = max(x(1),x(i),x(n))

for 4 values; 1,2,3,4 max = 4

  
**sum** - For each sink point, calculate the sum of n values from source attribute  attsrc    
sink_val = x(1) + x(i)... + x(n)

for 4 values; 1,2,3,4 sum = 10

  

>>

>>

cmosink, attsink are the cmo name and attribute name to write sink values
into. The scale method detirmines which calculation is applied to the source
attribute value and written to the sink attribute. All integer attributes are
converted to double for the calculations. The resulting values are then
converted to the nearest integer if the sink attribute is integer.

>>

>> indexed_set is the set of sink nodes to write scaled values to. 1,0,0 will
select all sink nodes

>>

>> cmosrc, attsrc are the cmo name and attribute name are the cmo and
attribute to interpolate from. Points from the source grid will be located
within the Voronoi volumes of sink nodes.

>> The following parameters are optional for the command
**upscale**.&nbsp_place_holder;

>>

>> boundary_choice  provides a method of choice when source nodes are found on
the boundary of multiple Voronoi volumes of sink nodes. By default, each set
of souce nodes found within each volume are used to calculate an upscale value
for the sink node. In this case if duplicate nodes occur on multiple cells,
the sum number of nodes used in upscale calculations will exceed the sum total
of nodes in the source mesh. If the number of source nodes used must equal the
number of source mesh nodes, choose an boundary_choice  to detirmine which
sink volume an boundary node should be assigned to. The result is a one-to-one
correspondence with each source point assigned to a single sink node id which
is stored in source attribute pt_gtg. Source nodes that are found on shared
Voronoi boundaries are flagged in source attribute dups_gtg.

>>

>>> **single** selects the Voronoi volume of the first sink node encountered
and does not use any after that.

**divide** not implemented.   
**_multiple_** uses all source nodes found in each sink Voronoi volume.   

>>

>> att_option is used during multiple calls to **upscale** with the same two
grids. It keeps source attributes created during the search routines and uses
these attributes to look up associated node numbers. The **upscale** command
uses kdtree to create the source attribute pt_gtg that associates source nodes
to sink node volumes. Note that this correlation is one-to-one and source
nodes sharing multiple Voronoi volume boundary are tagged in a second source
attribute called dups_gtg.

>>

>>> **_delatt_** deletes any attributes created during the kdtree searches. By
default these attributes are removed.

  
**keepatt** keeps attributes pt_gtg and dups_gtg created during the kdtree searches. The source node attribute pt_gtg has the first found sink node id. The node attribute dups_gtg is flagged each time the source node occurs in a sink Voronoi cell, allowing the user to find source nodes on cell boundaries. Use of this attribute will greatly reduce CPU time.   
  
**set_id** creates and keeps the source attribute pt_gtg containing sink id numbers found from the sink mesh. This is the same attribute created and kept for the **keepatt** option except that if the attribute already exists, it is deleted and re-created with a new search. This is recomended if the pt_gtg attribute exists, but user is not sure the current sink mesh is the same as used to create the attribute.

>> EXAMPLES 1 and 2:

Upscale 1221 source points to 10 sink points with using method **sum** and
showing the difference between allowing multiple use of nodes on Voronoi cell
boundaries and the single option which uses nodes on cell boundaries only
once. Images showing the source and sink points are shown below.

>>

>> Example 1:

>>

>>> cmo/setatt/cmo_src/ival/1,0,0/ 1

**upscale / sum /** cmo_sink icount /1,0,0/ cmo_src ival  
math/sum/cmo_src/sumtot/1,0,0/cmo_src/ival

  
In this example, search will find the sets of source nodes enclosed within
each sink Voronoi cell.The ival attribute values are added for each set and
written to the sink icount attribute. Because the attribte ival has all values
set to 1, the icount attribute will contain the number of source nodes found
in each Voronoi volume. The source node values will be counted regardless if
they are on a Voronoi boundary and are in multiple Voronoi volumes. The result
with duplicate boundary points will be a sum of points used greater than the
total number of source mesh points.

In this example, math/sum will result in at total greater than the number of
nodes used if there are duplicatate Voronoi boundary points.

>>

>> Example 2:

>>

>>> cmo/setatt/cmo_src/ival/1,0,0/ 1

**upscale / sum /** cmo_sink icount /1,0,0/ cmo_src ival/ **single keepatt**   
math/sum/cmo_src/sumtot/1,0,0/cmo_src/ival

  
This is the same as Example 1 except that duplicate boundary points will be
counted for the first found Voronoi volume and skipped thereafter. This one-
to-one correspondance of source nodes to sink Voronoi volume will be stored in
the source attributes pt_gtg with sink node numbers, and dups_gtg containing
flags of the duplicate boundary points. These attributes will not be deleted.

In this example, math/sum will result in a total equal to the number of nodes
used.

Result Sink nodes 1 and 2 are the two lower nodes of the single quad element
in image.

Source nodes are on the two adjacent quad elements.
