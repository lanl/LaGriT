##  memory

These commands report the current state of LaGriT's dynamic memory allocation.
LaGriT arrays are referenced by memory management by a two part name, block
name and partition name. It is allocated in integer or real blocks(real is
implemented as real*8). Each memory block is preceeded by a header and
terminated by a trailer. Different platforms will have different values for
integer and real word lengths. LaGriT developers read more on LaGriT memory
management at **[Memory Manager](../memmang.html)**

  
  
The following memory keywords are recognized:

> &nbsp_place_holder;

**memory / verify &nbsp_place_holder;**   
verify the integerity of LaGriT memory manager storage by checking that the
known blocks have not been overwritten. If corruption is detected, an array
map will be printed. Nothing is printed if there memory is successfully
verified.

  
  
**memory / print &nbsp_place_holder;**   
print an address map of the LaGriT managed arrays. For each array the
following is printed; index, length, type, memory address, associated name,
and partition. The partition is the grouping of arrays by usage. Common
partitions include the mesh object (by name), global memory, and temporary
memory for work arrays.

**memory / maxmalloc &nbsp_place_holder;**   
Report estimate of possible amount of memory available for allocation by
LaGriT. This test will make incremental calls to internal LaGriT memory
allocation (mmgetblk) until failure. The report will include the total
Megabytes where allocation succeeded, and amount at which allocation failed.
This command will also print a map of the memory manager storage.

The 64 bit version for memory routines will look slightly different:
