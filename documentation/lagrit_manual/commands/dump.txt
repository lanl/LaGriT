> **_DUMP_**

This command produces an output file from a Mesh Object. Some of the standard
graphics packages are supported including AVS, GMV and TECPLOT. See below for
full list of file types that can be written. The list is in alphabetic order
and describes each valid file_type with syntax and usage.

  
GENERAL SYNTAX:

**dump**/file_type/file_name/[cmo_name]/ The dump command is followed by a word indicating file type. Valid file type kewords are: ** gmv, avs, avs2, chad, coord, datex, elem_adj_node, elem_adj_elem, fehm, geofest, geom, gmv, gocad, lagrit, recolor, stl, stor, tecplot, zone, zone_imt, **and** zone_outside** .   
The file_type is followed by a string to be used as whole or part of file name
as described below.

SHORT SYNTAX:

**dump**/ file_name.[**inp | avs | gmv | lg | lagrit | ts | exo** ] / [cmo_name]    
  
For common file types, a short form syntax can be used which skips the file
type designation. The file_type is asssumed from the file_name suffix. The
following are recognized; AVS (.inp or .avs), Exodus (.exo), GMV (.gmv),
LaGriT (.lagrit or .lg), and .ts (gocad).

  
  
  
FILE TYPES:

  
**dump** /** avs** /file_name/[cmo_name] /[iopt_points,iopt_elements,iopt_node_attributes,iopt_element_attributes]   
  
Output in AVS UCD (Unstructured Cell Data) format. One can turn on or off the
output of node coordinates (iopt_points), element connectivity
(iopt_elements), node attributes (iopt_node_attributes) and element attributes
(iopt_element_attributes). 1 (default) is on, 2 is on but the first column
will not include the node number or element number, 0 turns off output of that
part of the file. For instance,  dump/avs/file.inp/cmo_name/1,1,0,0  will
write the node coordinates and element connectivity, but will not write node
attributes or element attributes.

**Use the =2 option with caution** since the output will really not be AVS format files. This is fine as long as you do not expect read/avs or the AVS graphics program to read the file.  
For file format specification see [http://help.avs.com/Express/doc/help/refere
nce/dvmac/UCD_Form.htm](http://help.avs.com/Express/doc/help/reference/dvmac/U
CD_Form.htm)

  
**dump / avs2 / **file_name/[cmo_name]/[iopt_points,iopt_elements,iopt_node_attributes,iopt_element_attributes]  
  
This option will output integers as integers instead of floating point. The
other avs option converts integers to reals on output. The /avs/ option above
outputs all attributes as real numbers. This option is slower but the files
are smaller if there are integers in the node or element attributes.

  
**dump**** **/** chad **** **/file_name/[cmo_name]/   
  
Will output a file nodes, faces, and connectivity for tet, hex, pyr, or pri in
CHAD format. Writes attributes imt and itp.

**dump**** **/** coord**** **/file_name/[cmo_name]/ (See also **dump/fehm** )   
  
Will output a single file with node list x,y,z values and element connectivity
list in FEHM format. Files are written in FEHM format and are described [by
clicking here for details.](dump/DUMP3.html)

The ** coord ** file is one of a set of files written when the **fehm** file
type is called.

  
**dump**** **/** datex | simul**** **/file_name/[cmo_name]/   
  
Will output a file with Geometry, Element, Region, Location, and Dataset in
DATEX format.

**dump / elem_adj_elem **/ file_name/mo_name [_delatt_ | keepatt | attonly]    
  
Option: **delatt** - Write adjacency information to an ascii file. Write list
of all elements adjacent to each element.

File format: elem_number ean_num e1 e2 ... en

Option: **keepatt** - write file and add node attribute **ean_num** (number of
elements adjacent to each node)

Option: **attonly** - do not write file, add node attribute ean_num, a dummy
argument is still required in the file_name field

  
**dump / elem_adj_node **/file_name/mo_name   
  
Write adjacency information to an ascii file. Write list of all elements
adjacent to each node.

File format:

node_number number_of_adjacent_elem e1 e2 ... en &nbsp_place_holder;

  
** dump / exo** / file_name/ mo_name   
** dump / exo** / file_name/ mo_name / psets / eltsets / facesets   
** dump / exo** / file_name/ mo_name / psets / eltsets / facesets file1 file2 ... filen  
** dump / exodusii ** / file_name/ mo_name   
** dump / exodusII ** / file_name/ mo_name   
  
Write a mesh object to a file in the Exodus II format.

Write out a series of files for the FEHM flow and transport code. The tokens
after the cmo name are all optional. The default options will

delete the outside node attributes and will not add attributes for the outside
voronoi or median areas.

The stor file will be written in ASCII format with scalar coefficient values
with compression of area coefficient list and indices.

[Click here for more details on the files and
options.](dump/DUMP3.html)&nbsp_place_holder;

  
The file_name is used to form the names of the following 7 files:

file_name.fehm - coordinates and geometry ( see dump/coord/... command)

file_name_material.zone - node imt (material) zone lists ( see
dump/zone_imt/... command)

file_name_outside.zone - node external boundary zone lists (see
dump/zone_outside/... command)

file_name_outside_vor.area - node external boundary area lists (see
dump/zone_outside/... command)

file_name_interface.zone - zone lists for nodes along material interfaces

file_name_multi_mat.zone - lists of node pairs connected across material
interfaces

file_name.stor - FEHM format file giving the voronoi (control volume)
associated with each node and the sparce matrix structure

**dump / geofest**/file_name   
  
Write a file to be read by the [GeoFEST, Geophysical Finite Element Simulation
Tool](http://www.openchannelfoundation.org/projects/GeoFEST/)
.&nbsp_place_holder; The output file is ascii.

  
**dump / geom**/file_name   
  
will write an ascii file containing the geometry information for the current
run. This information includes the region and mregion definitions and surface,
names, types and definitions.

  
**dump/gmv**/file-name/[mesh-object]/[**_ascii _**| **binary**]   
  
Write a file to be read by the graphics program
[GMV](http://laws.lanl.gov/XCM/gmv/GMVHome.html).&nbsp_place_holder; The
defaults are binary and current mesh object.
&nbsp_place_holder;NOTE:&nbsp_place_holder; For LaGriT versions dated after
October 1999, use &nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;
**cmo**/**setatt**//**ipolydat**/**no**&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;
to reduce file size. This command will keep the polygon data from being
written to GMV files.

  
**dump / gocad **/file_name   
  
Write a gocad TSURF file. See [ GOCAD TSURF](http://www.connectflow.com/geovis
age/User/Formats/GocadTsurf.html).&nbsp_place_holder;

**dump / lagrit **/file_name/[cmo_name]/ [**ascii **| **binary**]    
  
Write a LaGriT restart file that contains geometry and mesh object
information.&nbsp_place_holder; cmo_name can be '**-all-**' in which case all
mesh objects are written to the file or it can specify a list of mesh objects
to be written. A subsequent **read/lagrit** command will restart the code at
the state at which the dump command was issued. The default file type is
binary.

&nbsp_place_holder; **dump / recolor**/file_name

  
This command writes the existing **colormap** to the specified
file.&nbsp_place_holder; (See **[colormap](COLORMAP.html)** command)

  
**dump / stl **/file_name   
  
Output in STL, stereo lithography format. This is only supported for triangle
mesh objects.

  
**dump / stor** / file_name_root / cmo_name /  [ **_ascii_ | binary** ] /   
&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;&n
bsp_place_holder; &nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;/ [**_scalar_ | vector
| both | area_scalar | area_vector | area_both**]

&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;&n
bsp_place_holder; &nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;/ [**_all_ | graph |
coefs | none**] / [**hybrid | _nohybrid_ **]

  
Same syntax as **dump/fehm** except the only output is the FEHM sparse matrix
coefficient STOR file file_name.stor.

File can be written in ascii or binary (fortran unformatted platform
dependent). The area coefficient values can be written as scalar or vector.

The compression default is all which will compress both the list of area
coefficients and the indices. The coefs compression, or none compression both
use and older algorithm and will result in larger files and may take longer to
run.

The ** stor ** file is one of a set of files written when the **fehm** file
type is called.

[Click here for the STOR file format.](../STOR_Form.html)

  
  
**dump / tecplot **/file_name   
  
Write a file to be read by the Tecplot graphics package.&nbsp_place_holder;
The output file is ascii. Only node attributes are output, element attributes
are ignored and not output. Tecplot does not support prism or pyramid element
types so they are written as eight node, degenerate hex elements. The ioflag
parameter is used to control if the node attributes are output or not is the
AVS ioflag. The expected suffix for the file name is '.plt'. If a name is
given without the .plt suffix, a suffix, .plt is added. Output is ascii. This
output format does not support output of a mesh with nodes but zero elements.
If there are zero elements, a header is written but node coordinate
information is not output.

  
**dump** / **zone** /file_name/[cmo_name] /  [**_delatt_ | keepatt**]&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder; [**_keepatt_voronoi_ | keepatt_median**]    
  
Write out a set of fehm format zone files for the mesh object nodes. These
include zones for mesh materials and the external faces of the mesh as
described below. The **keepatt** option will keep node attributes that tag
nodes on external mesh boundaries (see zone_outside). The **delatt** option
will delete the outside attributes if they exist (the are removed by default).
The area attributes for outside nodes can be created with the
**keepatt_voronoi** or **keepatt_median** options (see zone_outside).

  
Files are written in FEHM format and are described in the dump/fehm command
[by clicking here for details.](dump/DUMP3.html)

  
The file_name is used to create names for the following 5 files:

file_name_material.zone - node imt (material) zone lists ( see
dump/zone_imt/... command)

file_name_outside.zone - node external boundary zone lists (see
dump/zone_outside/... command)

file_name_outside_vor.area or file_name_outside_med.area - node external
boundary area lists (see dump/zone_outside/... command)

file_name_interface.zone - zone lists for nodes along material interfaces, 0
length file if mesh is single material

file_name_multi_mat.zone - lists of node pairs connected across material
interfaces, 0 length file if mesh is single material

  
  
**dump** / **zone_imt** /file_name/[cmo_name] /  [ imt_value ]&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;   
  
Will output only one file with name file_name_material.zone. It is written in
FEHM zone format and are described [by clicking here for
details.](dump/DUMP3.html)

file_name_**material**.**zone** is node list for each integer material (imt)
value. If the optional fifth argument is specified as an integer, then a node
list file is written only listing the nodes with the value specified by
imt_value.

([For options to output PSET's as ZONE/ZONN files see: pset/zone](PSET.html))

The ** zone_imt ** file is one of a set of files written when the **fehm**
file type is called.

  
**dump** / **zone_outside** | **zone_outside_minmax** /file_name/[cmo_name] /    
&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;
[**_delatt_ | keepatt**]&nbsp_place_holder; [**_keepatt_voronoi_ |
keepatt_median**]

  
Write fehm zone format files that list the outside node list and the
associated outside area list.

  
There are two files written:

  
1. file_name_outside.zone is a node list for each of 6 possible external
boundaries.

If keepatt is specified, then 6 node based attributes are added to the mesh
object with the names top, bottom, left_w, right_e, back_n, and front_s. A
node can occur in multiple zones. For instance, a node located on a top corner
of the mesh can be found in zones for top, front_s, and left_w.

1 = top = top = positive z direction (0,0,1)

2 = bottom = bottom = negative z direction (0,0,-1)

3 = left_w = left or west = negative x direction (-1,0,0)

4 = front_s = front or south = negative y direction (0,-1,0)

5 = right_e = right or east = positive x direction (1,0,0)

6 = back_n = back or north = positive y direction (0,1,0)

  
2. file_name_outside_vor.area is a list of Voronoi area vectors
(Ax_i,Ay_i,Az_i) associated with each external node. It is written to match
the node lists as written in the outside.zone file. Along with each outside
zone tag (such as top), there is a sum of each vector for that zone. For
applications such as infiltration, the z component (each 3rd value) would be
used from the top zone list.

    
    00001  top   Sum VORONOI vectors:  0.5000000E+00 0.5000000E+00 0.5000000E+00  
    nnum  
       3  
      -2.500000000000E-01  -2.500000000000E-01   2.500000000000E-01   2.500000000000E-01   0.000000000000E+00   1.250000000000E-01  
       0.000000000000E+00   2.500000000000E-01   1.250000000000E-01  
      
    

  
If the keyword keepatt_voronoi is specified, three node attributes (xn_varea,
yn_varea, zn_varea) representing the voronoi area are added.

If the keyword keepatt_median is specified, three node attributes (xn_marea,
yn_marea, zn_marea) representing the median area are added and the file name
will be file_name_outside_med.area. Note that the old version file name
file_name_outside.area has area vectors computed with the median strategy.

  
The option **zone_outside_minmax** is used to find the min and max external
node along each row and column of the regular grid. [Click here for image
](../../images/zone_outside.png) showing difference between the default and
the minmax options for outside nodes.

  
These **zone_outside** files are part of a set of files written when the
**zone** or **fehm** file type is called. The fehm zone format and
descriptions are&nbsp_place_holder; [in the **dump/fehm** command
details.](dump/DUMP3.html)
