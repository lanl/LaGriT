> **_SETTETS_**

Set element color** (**itetclr) and create child points at interior
interfaces. This command can also be used to set the node color from the
element color.

If there are no options **settets** and **settets/color_tets** sets the color
of all elements using the following tests. If the element contains a non-
interface point, the element color is set to this value. If the element is
comprised entirely of interface points, the centroid of the element is
calculated and the material region containing this point is determined; the
element color is set to this material. If the centroid of the element is not
in any material region, the centroid must be on an interface surface. In this
case all vertices of the element are examined and the material common to all
vertices is selected as the element color.

**settets**/ **parents** has exactly the same behavior as **settets **except that existing values of itetclr are used for elements containing non-interface nodes.

**geometry**&nbsp_place_holder; sets the&nbsp_place_holder; element color&nbsp_place_holder; based on the material region containing the centroid of the element for all elements; existing values of itetclr are ignored.

**color_points**&nbsp_place_holder; sets the node material (imt1) from the element color (itetclr); existing values of itetclr are not changed.

**settets/newtets **has the same behavior** **as** settets **except that existing positive values of itetclr are not changed.

**settets/normal** assigns the itetclr array of a triangle mesh to an integer value depending on the normal vector direction.&nbsp_place_holder; There are 26 possible direction that correspond to the 6 faces, 12 edges and 8 corners of a cube.&nbsp_place_holder; In general most triangles will be assigned one of 6 values which correspond to the 6 sectors which are within 45 degrees of the 6 unit vectors: 1 0 0 , 0 1 0 , 0 0 1, -1 0 0, 0 -1 0, 0 0 -1   
NOTE:&nbsp_place_holder; Valid only for triangle mesh.
