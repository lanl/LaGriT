>> Removes any points that are within the specified point range and specified
volume of space. This is done in Cartesian (**xyz**), cylindrical (**rtz**),
or spherical (**rtp**) coordinates. It should be noted that in cylindrical
coordinates, theta is the angle in the XY- plane with respect to the x-axis,
while in spherical coordinates theta is the angle with respect to the Z-axis
and phi is the angle in the XY-plane with respect to the X-axis. In
cylindrical coordinates the cylinder always lines up along the z axis; use the
**coordsys **command before issuing the **rm **command if the points to be
removed are not aligned with the z-axis; then issue a final **coordsys**
command to return to normal. Also note that the points that are removed become
dudded out (point type set to 21) and are not removed from the data array.

>> The other options are:

>> geometry -- **xyz**, **rtz**, **rtp**

ifirst,ilast,istride -- point range to search

xmin, ymin, zmin -- minimums of geometry type coordinates

xmax, ymax, zmax -- maximums of geometry type coordinates

xcen, ycen, zcen -- center of removal space for geometry

xscale, yscale, zscale -- scaling factors for geometry limits
