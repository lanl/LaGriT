.. _bubble:

**_BUBBLE_**

> This command takes a topologically 2d mesh (a planar or non-planar surface),
extrudes it into three dimensions along either the normal to the surface
(default) or along a user defined vector, and then takes the external surface
of the volume created and returns that to the user.

>

> This operation will result in a closed surface.

FORMAT:

> **bubble**/mesh1/mesh2/**const|min**/offset/[**norm**|x1,y1,z1]

mesh1 is the name of the resulting mesh.

mesh2 is the name of the initial mesh. This mesh must be either made up of
**tris, quads, or hybrids**.

**const** is a keyword that indicates that the distance from each of the points in the initial mesh along the extruding vector will be equal to offset.Therefore, if you wanted the closed surface mesh to have the same surface characteristics as the original mesh on both the initial and newly formed surface or edge, you would use **const**.

**min** is a keyword that indicates that the minimum distance along the extruding vector to a reference plane that is perpendicular to the extruding vector will be equal to offset. This means that if you want a closed surface mesh with at least one flat side, you would use **min**. This also means that if you use **min**, bubble computes the "bottom point" on the initial mesh, or the point closest to the reference plane, and then extrudes that point by min, all the other points will be extruded by a larger distance. This avoids the problem of having the initial surface intersect the reference plane that forms the other side of the closed surface mesh.

offsetis the length of extrusion. It can either be an integer or a real.

The final argument is optional. It must either be the keyword **norm**, or a
three valued vector (in cartesian space) specifying a direction. The default,
if no argument is provided, is **norm**. If **norm** is chosen, the element
weighted average normal to the surface or curve is computed, and the initial
mesh is extruded in that direction. Otherwise, if a vector value is specified,
the vector is normalized, and its direction used to extrude the initial mesh.

NOTES:

> This code works on meshes containing quads, triangles, or hybrid polygons.

>

> It is very possible to create an invalid mesh object with this command,
especially if the initial mesh is a multivalued surface, or if the extruding
vector is in a direction parallel to the plane that contains the initial
surface is in. You have been warned.

>

> There is an analog to this code that creates the volume enclosed by the
surface as opposed to the surface itself. It is called
**[extrude.](extrude.html)**

>

> This code is a wrapper for **extrude**. There are plans to integrate
**bubble**'s functionality with **extrude** and to eliminate **bubble** from
the commands recognized by LaGriT.

EXAMPLES:

> **bubble**/cmo_bigbox/cmo_quad/**const**/5.0/

>

> This would result in a surface surrounding an amalgamation of
parallelopipeds created from the initial quad sheet. First, since **const** is
used the quads will be extruded a constant amount from each point in the quad
sheet. Second, since the extruding vector and **norm** are omitted, the
extrusion will occur on the average normal to the plane. Therefore, this
command will result in a mesh of tris that form the surface of a group of
parallelopipeds extruded 5.0 units in an orthogonal direction.

>

> **bubble**/cmo_arbshape/cmo_tri/**min**/7.5/3,-2.5,-6

>

> This command would result in a mesh of tris that form a surface enclosing a
volume of prisms being created out of the initial tri sheet. First, since
**min** is used, the "bottom" of the surface would be a plane. Second, because
the vector 3, -2.5, -6 is specified, the extrusion will be in that direction
(again the magnitude is not important, the vector is normalized to a unit
vector), not in the direction of the average normal of the initial tri
surface.
