> **_SURFPTS_**

> > Generates points on boundary surfaces previously defined by the surface or
region command. The variable** **itype can be **surface** or **region** and
iname is the name of the surface or region. The points are generated by
shooting rays through a user specified set of points from an origin point,
line or plane and finding the surface intersection of each ray. The point
location for a region is determined by iregpt and can be on the **inside**,
**outside** or **both** surfaces.

**surfpts**/itype/iname/iregpt/**pset,get,setname/**geom/ray_origin   
Where ifirst,ilast,istride or **pset,get**,setname define the set of points to
shoot rays through. SPECIFICALLY FOR ALLOWABLE GEOMETRY TYPES:

**surfpts**/itype/iname/iregpt/ifirst,ilast,istride/**xyz**/x1,y1,z1/x2,y2,z2/x3,y3,z   
Where points 1, 2, 3 define the plane to shoot rays from that are normal to
the plane.

**surfpts**/itype/iname/iregpt/ifirst,ilast,istride/ **rtz**/x1,y1,z1/x2,y2,z2 /   
Where points 1, 2, define the line to shoot rays from that are perpendicular
to the line.

**surfpts**/itype/iname/iregpt/ifirst,ilast,istride/ **rtp**/xcen,ycen,zcen/   
**surfpts**/itype/iname/iregpt/ifirst,ilast,istride/ **points **/iffirst,iflast,ifstride/   
Where ifirst,ilast,istride define a set of points to shoot rays from.
