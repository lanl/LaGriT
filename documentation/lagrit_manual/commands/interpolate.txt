.. _interpolate:

##  INTERPOLATE

> The **interpolate** (or **intrp**) command is used to interpolate attribute
values from nodes or elements of a source mesh to node or element attributes
of a sink mesh. Normally the source grid is coarser or the same resolution as
the sink grid. **interpolate** replaces method options in the **doping**
command called **integer1, integer2**, and **table**.

>

> The **interpolate** methods depend on the location of sink nodes as they
relate to the source grid nodes or elements. The interpolations are from
either source nodes or elements on to sink points. The **interpolate** values
are written to the indicated sink attribute for each sink point. If the
indicated sink attribute is of element type, then the centroids for each
element are calculated and used for the interpolated sink points.

>

> The intrp_method parameter includes **map**, **voronoi**, and
**continuous**. The **map** method copies the value from the enclosing source
element. **continuous** interpolates on to a sink point using the enclosing
source element nodes. Method **voronoi** copies the value from the nearest
source node.

>

> The remaining **interpolate** parameters are all optional on the command
line. tie_option is used to break a tie when a sink point has more than one
valid candidate source node or element. flag_option is used to assign an error
value, or to assign a value for points not inside the source mesh.
intrp_function allows the interpolation function associated with the sink
attribute to be set. A kdtree node or element search is used to pair the
source mesh to the sink mesh points. Each sink point is paired with either an
element or point found with the search. This one-to-one correspondence can be
saved as a sink cmo attribute. These attributes are reused during multiple
calls to the **interpolate** command instead of repeating a long search. The
keyword that allows the attributes to be kept as part of the sink cmo is
**keepatt**.

>

> The valid element types depend on the **interpolate** method being used. For
instance, a valid **continuous** interpolation can not currently be applied
using a hex element. Use **hextotet** to convert hex elements of the source
grid to tets.

For valid combinations of **interpolate** methods and options, see the Tables
below.

  
  

> The format for the command line is as follows:

**interpolate **/ intrp_method / cmosink, attsink / 1,0,0 / cmosrc, attsrc /  
[tie_option] [flag_option] [keep_option] [intrp_function]

Parameters appearing after the source cmo attribute name are optional.

  
  
intrp_method is the choice of interpolation methods. These methods evolved
from methods available in the **doping** command. The **map** method replaces
**doping/integer1** which copied source itetclr values to sink imt values. The
**voronoi** method replaces **doping/integer2** which copied nearest node
source imt to sink imt. **continuous** evolved from the **doping/table**
command. These commands are still similar to the old versions except that they
have been generalized to include user chosen attributes and more element
types. The choices for intrp_method are as follows:

>

>> **map** - For each sink point, search source cmo for an enclosing element.
Copy the found source element value to the sink attribute. The source
attribute is of type element. To copy from a source attribute of type node,
use **voronoi** method.

**voronoi** - For each sink point, search the source cmo for a nearest node. Copy found source node value to the sink attribute. The source attribute is of type node. To copy from a source attribute of type element, use **map** method. By selecting the nearest source points, Voronoi regions are generated around each sink point. The sink point (node or centroid) is given the value of the attribute associated with the Voronoi generating point whose Voronoi cell the sink point lands in.   
**continuous** - For each sink point, search the source cmo for an enclosing element. Use the vertices of enclosing element to interpolate a value on to the sink point. The source attribute is of type node. The interpolation is the sum of vertice values multiplied by the relative volume of elements formed by the sink point location on or inside the found element. The element is divided into volumes as determined by the sink point location and its relationship to the vertices of the enclosing element. A triangle becomes three triangles each with a vertices on the sink point. A quad becomes four quads. A tet becomes four tets. WARNING: A hex becomes 8 hexs which depends on orthogonal hexs and so is not currently supported. Use hextotet to convert hex elements to tets. Each vertice value of the found element is multiplied by these relative volumes. The assigned sink point value is the sum of these values divided by the number of element vertices. The interpolation function belonging to the attribute is applied to the vertice values before being summed. These interpolate types include LINEAR, ASINH, and LOG. Other interpolate functions such as min, max, and copy pass the value unchanged. See the cinterpolate() routine for how these interpolation types are handled. The final value of the sink point has the inverse function operation applied.   
**default** - If source attribute is element type then use **_map_**. If source attribute is node type then use **_continuous_**.

>

cmosink, attsink are the cmo name and attribute name to write interpolated
values into. The interpolation are applied to the points of the sink cmo. If
the sink attribute is element type, centroids are calculated for each element
and these are used for the interpolation methods. All integer attributes are
converted to double for the interpolation routines. The interpolated values
are then converted to integer if the sink attribute is integer.

>

> indexed_set is the set of sink nodes or elements to write interpolated
values to. 1,0,0 will select all sink nodes or elements.&nbsp_place_holder;

>

> cmosrc, attsrc are the cmo name and attribute name are the cmo and attribute
to interpolate from. Points from the sink grid will be located within source
elements or nearest source nodes depending on the method used.

> The following parameters are optional for the command
**interpolate**.&nbsp_place_holder;

>

> tie_option  provides a method of choice when multiple candidates are found
for nearest node or enclosing element. Along with kdtree search,
nearestpoint() and retrieve_within_eps() routines return a list of candidate
objects for a sink point. These can be either a list of closest points, or a
list of elements the point is on or inside. tie_option chooses one candidate
from the possible candidates. The result is a one-to-one correspondence with
each sink point paired with a single source node or a single source element.

>

>> **_tiemax_** selects the maximum value from candidate nodes or elements.
This is the default selection.

**tiemin** selects the minimum value from candidate nodes or elements. 
>

> flag_option is the value used to initialize the sink attribute. These flag
values indicate either that there was an error and a value could not be
written to the sink attribute. The kdtree element search will assign a flag
value if a sink point is located outside the source grid.

>

>> **_plus1_** will assign a flag value of maximum source value plus 1.

**nearest/**near_attribute will find the nearest source node and use the node's attribute value as the flag value. The keyword **nearest** must be followed with the name of the source node attribute to use for the flag values.   
flag_option given as an integer or real value will use the user's numeric
value for the flag assignments.

>

> keep_option is used during multiple calls to **interpolate** with the same
two grids. It keeps attributes created during the search routines and uses
these attributes to look up associated node or element numbers. The
**interpolate** command uses kdtree to create sink attributes that pair sink
points to associated source node or element numbers. If **map** or
**continuous** methods are used, the element attribute named el_gtg will be
created. If **voronoi** or the flag_option **nearest** are used, the node
attribute named pt_gtg will be created.

>

>> **_delatt_** deletes any attributes created during the kdtree searches. By
default these attributes are removed.

**keepatt** keeps any attributes created during the kdtree searches. The attribute names are pt_gtg for nearest node numbers, and el_gtg for enclosing element numbers. 
>

> intrp_function replaces the interpolation function associated with the sink
attribute. This interpolation function is applied to the final interpolated
field value. Valid interpolate functions are linear, asinh, log, copy,
sequence, min, incmin, max, incmax, and, or, user. Functions such as min and
max pass the interpolation value unchanged.

> EXAMPLES:

>

>> **interpolate / map /** cmo_sink imt /1,0,0/ cmo_src itetclr

For each node in cmo_sink find an enclosing element from mesh cmo_src. Assign
the element's itetclr value to the corresponding imt attribute of cmo_sink.

>

>> **interpolate/ map /** cmo_sink Pval /1,0,0/ cmo_src Vval / tiemin, log

This command will assign source Vval values to sink Pval for elements
enclosing cmo_sink points. If the sink point is found within more than one
element, the min value of the candidate elements will be chosen. Since the
interpolation function "log" is named, it will be applied to the source Vval
value before being written to sink attribute Pval.

>

>> **interpolate/ voronoi **/ cmo_sink imt /1,0,0/ cmo_src imt

For each node in cmo_sink, find the closest node in cmo_src. Assign the imt
value from the closest cmo_src node to the imt attribute of cmo_sink.

>

>> **interpolate/ continuous** / cmo_sink xval /1,0,0/ cmo_src Pv

For each node in cmo_sink, find a cmo_src element the node is inside.
Interpolate the element node values in Pv on to the sink point and write to
the sink attribute xval.

>

>> **interpolate/ map** /cmo_sink imt /1,0,0/ cmo_src itetclr / **nearest,**
imt / **keepatt**

**interpolate/ map **/cmo_sink imtreal /1,0,0/ cmo_src itetreal / **nearest,** imtreal   
The first call to interpolate will assign itetclr values from source elements
to imt in the sink cmo for points inside the source elements. Any sink point
not inside the source grid will be assigned the imt value of the nearest
source point. Since keepatt is set, both attributes pt_gtg and el_gtg will be
kept as sink cmo attributes and hold the node and element numbers for each
sink point.

The second call to interpolate will find the sink attributes pt_gtg and
el_gtg. The nearest point and enclosing element kdtree searches will be
skipped. This time the element value in attribute itetreal will be assigned to
the sink node attribute imtreal. For points outside the grid, values from
nearest node attribute imtreal will be used. Note that the **delatt** keyword
does not have to exist, the interpolate attributes are always deleted unless
the keyword **keepatt** is used.
