>

>> Associate a name with a point set based on various geometric and logical
operators. Manipulate point sets. Output point sets.

>>

>> **seq** forms a pset of the nodes defined by ifirst, ilast, istride;

the special syntax,: 1,0,0 refers to all nodes and 0,0,0 refers to the last
set of nodes created.

**union, inter** and **not** are logical operations on previously defined psets.&nbsp_place_holder; The definition of the unary operator **not **is extended such that **not**/p1/p2 means p1 and (not(p2)).   
**list **lists nodes in a pset or names of all psets   
**write **write pset node list to a file   
pset / [name|_-all-_] / write/ file_name[.vertexset] / [_ascii_|binary]

**zone **write pset node list to a file (FEHM Flow and Transport code zone file format)   
pset / [name|_-all-_] / zone / file_name[.zone] / [ascii]

**zonn **write pset node list to a file (FEHM Flow and Transport code zonn file format)   
pset / [name|_-all-_] / zonn / file_name[.zonn] / [ascii]

In write|zone|zonn mode the file name suffix .vertexset|.zone|.zonn is added
if the string provided does not have the file name suffix. The -all- argument
specifies that all psets are output. The name argument is the name of a single
pset.

**delete **deletes a previously defined pset   
**attribute&nbsp_place_holder; **forms a pset from all points in** **ifirst,ilast,istride which have the specified value for a node based attribute. This option was previously named **zq.**   
If the optional comparator field is given; that operation is used to compare
the attribute value to the requested value.

**geom/xyz/** forms a pset from all points inside the box whose corners are xl,yl,zl and xu,yu,zu relative to the geometry center at xc,yc,zc.   
**geom/rtz/** forms a pset of nodes within the cylinder or cylindrical shell given by radius r1 to r2, angle theta t1 to t2 and height z1 to z2.   
**geom/rtp**/ forms a pset of nodes within the sphere, sperical shell or sperical section given by radius r1 to r2, and angles theta t1 to t2 and angles phi p1 to p2.&nbsp_place_holder; [See chapter II, A. Conventions](../conventions.html) for an explanation of angles theta and phi.   
**region**/region name/ifirst,ilast,istride   
**mregion**/mregion name/ifirst,ilast,istride will return all nodes that are in the specified region/mregion - the definition of the region/mregion is evaluated to determine membership.&nbsp_place_holder; Hence the result may vary from what would be returned if the 'imt1' value of the nodes had been queried using the **attribute** option  
**surface** identifies nodes on the specified surface.&nbsp_place_holder; Keyword surface names have the following meaning:
>>

>>> -**all**- will identify nodes on any surface.

-**interface**- will identify nodes on any interface surface.   
-**boundary**- will idendify nodes on exterior surfaces.

**eltset** form a pset of nodes in the element set listed.   
**constraints** forms a pset of nodes having the specified number of constraints.&nbsp_place_holder; The node's **icr** value is used as an index to the **icontab **attribute which gives the number of constraints.&nbsp_place_holder; [See chapter III, A](../meshobject.html) for an explanation of the **icontab** entries.

**surface**/surface_name/[ifirst,ilast,istride] **surface** will select nodes that are on the specified surface.&nbsp_place_holder; If **-interface- **is specified for the surface name, all interface&nbsp_place_holder; nodes&nbsp_place_holder; will be returned.&nbsp_place_holder; If** -boundary-** is specified for the surface name, all nodes on external bounding surfaces will be returned. If** -all-** is specified all nodes on any surface are returned.  
**eltset**/element_set_name **eltset **will return all nodes that are vertices of the elements in the specified element set **constraints**/number_of_constraints/ifirst,ilast,istride &nbsp_place_holder; EXAMPLES: **pset**/apset/**seq**/1,0,0/   
&nbsp_place_holder;associate the pset name apsetwith all points.

**pset**/apset/**seq**/0,0,0/   
&nbsp_place_holder;associate the pset name apsetwith the last set of nodes
created.

**pset**/apset/**union**/pset1,pset2,pset   
&nbsp_place_holder;associate the pset name apset with the set of nodes which
belong to at least one of pset1, pset2, pset3.

**pset**/apset/**inter**/pset1,pset2,pset3   
&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder; associate the pset name apset with the
set of nodes which belong to pset1, and pset2, and pset3.

**pset**/apset/**not**/pset1,pset2,pset3   
&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder; associate the pset name apset with the

**pset**/-all-/**write/root_name/ascii**   
Write list of nodes in all psets. root_name is treated as a root name and each
pset is written to a separate file beginning with that root. For example, if
you have psets named pset1 and pset2, they will be written to files called
root_name_pset1.vertexset and root_name_pset2.vertexset.

**pset**/mypset/**zone/file_name.zone/ascii**   
&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder; Write list of nodes in pset  mypset to

**pset**/apset/**attribute**/**itp**/1,0,0/10/**ge**   
&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder; associate the name apset with the
points whose type field(**itp1**) has value greater than or equal to 10 (these

on the surface s2 and which are members of the pset spset&nbsp_place_holder;
