> **_TRANS_**

In the first form of this command, **trans** translates a selected set of
points (ifirst,ilast,istride) in X,Y,Z space by picking one specific point
(xold,yold,zold) in the set of points and moving it to new coordinates
(xnew,ynew,znew) with a linear translation. This will then cause the remaining
points in the set to be moved by the same translation.

In the second form, if **center **is selected, the points set is translated so
that (0,0,0) is located at the midpoint of min x,y,z and max x,y,z of the
mesh. If **zero **is selected, the points set is translated so that (0,0,0) is
located at the min x,y,z of the mesh. If **original **is selected, the points
set is translated to the original location before **center** or **zero** was
called. Currently all translations are **xyz **(**rtp** and **rtz **are
reserved for future implementation). The values in the next optional field
indicate the axes along which to translate. For example, 1,1,0 or x,y will
translate along the x and y axes, the z values will not change.

&nbsp_place_holder; FORMAT:
**trans**/ifirst,ilast,istride/xold,yold,zold/xnew,ynew,znew

**trans/**ifirst,ilast,istride/**center**|**zero**|**original**/[**xyz**|**rtp**|**rtz**]/   
[xdim,ydim,zdim] EXAMPLE: **trans**/**pset,get,**mypoints/0.,0.,0./2.0,2.0,0./

The points in the **pset** mypoints will be moved 2 in the positive x
direction and 2 in the positive y direction.
