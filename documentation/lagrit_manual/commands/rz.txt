>> This command adds points to the mesh. It can distribute points evenly or
according to a ratio zoning method.

**xyz **specifies Cartesian coordinates.   
**rtz **specifies cylindrical coordinates.   
**rtp** specifies spherical coordinates.   
**line **this option implies xyz and will distribute n1 nodes from (xmin,ymin,zmin) to (xmax,ymax,zmaz)   
When using the rtz or rtp coordinate systems the center is at **(**0,0,0). Use
a **trans** command to move the center. For the **rtz **command, minimum and
maximum coordinates are the triplets: radius from the cylinder's axis, angle
in the xy-plane measured from the x-axis and height along the z-axis. For the
**rtp **command minimum and maximum coordinates are the triplets: radius from
the center of the sphere axis, angle in the zy-plane measured from the
positive z-axis and the angle in the xy-plane measured from the positive
x-axis (see II.a.11). Note that the **rtz **always results in a (partial)
cylinder of points centered around the z axis. Use the **rotateln **command to
orient the cylinder. For example, to center the cylinder around the y axis,
specify the x axis as the line of rotation in the **rotateln **command.

>>

>> ni,nj,nk number of points to be created in each direction.

xmin,ymin,zmin minimums for coordinates.

xmax,ymax,zmax maximums for coordinates.

iiz,ijz,ikz if =0 then mins and maxs are used as cell centers

if =1 then mins and maxs are used as cell vertices

iirat,ijrat,ikrat ratio zoning switches (0=off,1=on)

xrz,yrz,zrz ratio zoning value - distance is multiplied by this value for each
subsequent point.

&nbsp_place_holder; EXAMPLES:
**rz**/**xyz**/**5,3,10**/**0.,2.,0.**/**5.,6.,2.**/**1,1,1**/

This results in a set of 150 points, five across from x=0. to x=5., 3 deep
from y=2. to y=6. and 10 high from z=0. to z=2.

**rz/rtz/4,6,11**/**0.,0.,0.**/**3.,360.,10.**/**1,0,1**/   
This results in 264 points arranged around the z- axis. There are 3 rings of
points at distances r=1., r=2. and r=3. from the z-axis. There are 11 sets of
these three rings of points and heights z=0., z=1., z=2.,...,z=10. In each
ring there are 6 points where each pair of points is separated by 60°; note
that ijz=0 requests that points be placed at cell centers, hence the first
point will be at 30° not at 0°. Corresponding to r=0, there will be 6
identical points at 11 intervals along the z-axis at heights z=0., z=1.,
z=2.,...z=10. **Filter** should be used to remove these duplicate points.
