>> Copy a point distribution. There are two distinct forms of this command.
The first format is designed to copy points from one mesh object into another.
In this form if the names of the source and sink mesh objects are omitted, the
current mesh object will be used. The copy may be restricted to a subset of
points by including the source point information. Points in the sink mesh
object will be overwritten if sink_stride is not zero. Attribute fields may be
specified for both the source and sink mesh object. For example the
x-coordinate field in the source mesh object (xic) may be placed in the
y-coordinate field of the sink mesh object. Attribute values will be copied
from the source mesh object to the sink mesh object. The user is warned that
these values might not make sense in their new context.

>>

>> The second form of this command is included for historic reasons: it
duplicates points within a mesh object including all the attributes of the
points. Also note that if no sink points or sink stride are specified, then
the copied points are placed at the end of the data arrays (see third FORMAT)
otherwise the copied points are written over the existing points starting at
the 1st sink point. Note also that the first form of the command gives the
arguments sink first then source whereas the second form gives the source then
the sink.

>> **copypts/**3dmesh/2dmesh /

&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder; Copy all points in
2dmesh to the end of the 3dmesh point list.

**copypts/**3dmesh/2dmesh/0,0/**pset,get,**mypoints/   
&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder; Copy the point set
named mypoints from 2dmesh to the end of 3dmesh point list.

**copypts/3dmesh/2dmesh/100,4/pset,get,mypoints/boron/arsenic/**   
**&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;** Copy the arsenic field from the point set named mypoints from 2dmesh replacing the boron field at every fourth point beginning at point 100 in 3dmesh**.**   
**copypts/pset,get,mypoints/0,0/**   
**&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;**&nbsp_place_holder; Duplicate the point set named mypoints from the current mesh object and place the duplicated points at the end of the point list.   
**copypts//**/0,0**/pset,get,mypoints/**   
Duplicate the point set named mypoints from the current mesh object and place
the duplicated points at the end of the point list. Same effect as the example
directly above. The current mesh object is used since the fields are blank on
the command line
