This library includes general memory management, algorithm, and io routines used by LaGriT.  
See mm2000.F for a list of the memory routines.

These files are seldom changed and compile into the lib_util_$OS.a library.
See Versions.txt for changes before LaGriT open source. 

Makefile
##########################################################################
# GNU Make version 3.79.1 or later
# USAGE (use make, gmake, or gnumake according to setup): 
# make list  (no action, write to screen only)
#    will write files and names used for this session and OS
#
# make OR make lib 
#    creates optimized for platform LIB_o.a and  OBJDIR_o 
# make COPT=-g lib 
#    creates debug 32 bit for platform LIB_g.a and OBJDIR_g 
# make MOPT=64 lib 
#    sets 64 bit LIB64_o.a and OBJDIR64_o for platform 
# make MOPT=64 COPT=-g lib 
#    sets 64 bit LIB64_g.a and OBJDIR64_g for platform 
#    NOTE: make sure new mm2000.h is created from mm2000_header.F
#    This sets sizeof_int correctly to 8
#
# set compiler options
# COMPILER=ABSOFT or COMPILER=GFORTRAN
#
# For SUNOS, only the following is supported
# SUNOS 8 or newer use % source /n/env/local.sunwspro.12
#
# OBJDIR and LIB are formed by system query from make
# other compile flags are passed in from command line:
#
# make install 
#    creates or updates *.o in OBJDIR 
#    creates LIB_o.a in current directory 
#    creates LIB_o_DATETAG.a
#    copies both libs.a to LIBDIR
#    moves LIB_o_DATETAG.a OBJDIR
# make clean
#    removes *.o in OBJDIR (recommended before install)
# make clobber
#    removes all OBJDIRs and .a files 
# make help
#    list of targets and defined variables 
# make list
#    list of object files and variables 
# make options include:
#    -d (debug) -p (print rules and variables) -v (version)
#
# platform is detected by uname -s
# platform and compile mode are used to form lib name and object directories
# if LIBDIR or OBJDIR do not exist, they are created
#
# Note: assumes Makefile and Makefile.depends
# Note: compatible with gmake which is suggested for Solaris
# Note: assumes path to sh is defined on system, otherwise define here
# shell = /bin/sh
#
# Created Jan 7 2008 by tamiller@lanl.gov
# Modified Nov 2010 by tamiller@lanl.gov to use gfortran as default

====================================================
CAUTION: the preprocessor for mm2000.h is not working
on the mac platforms correctly.
Workaround ... just copy mm2000_m64.h to mm2000.h

Sample compile

rm -f mm2000.h
gcc -E -m64 -Dlinx64 mm2000_header.F -o mm2000.h

[ or cp mm2000_m64.h to mm2000.h]

make MOPT=64 COPT=-g lib
