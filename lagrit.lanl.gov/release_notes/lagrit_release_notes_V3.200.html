<h2>LaGriT V3.106 August 2015 </h2>

<p>Major update to write PFLOTRAN type option stor file and new syntax using Exodus II 6.9 libraries.
<br>
This version is used for code development by summer student Mikita Yanki that includes changes and scripts
to build LaGriT on windows with Exodus II V6 libraries. This is a branch that does not include
some of the V3.107 updates. Mikita's version is merged and contained in the V3.2 release.
</p>
<p><i>Note: The LaGriT run-time banner shows V3.2 with compile date  Aug 2015, even though it is actually a branch from V3.106.</i></p>

<p>Major updates include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>dump / pflotran</b>
<br>
Writes .uge file for pflotran and is used by the DFN suite of scripts.
The first block are the list of ids of cells and the coordinates of cell centroids and the volumes of the cells.
The second block consists of a list of ids of the connecting cells (id_up, id_dn), coordinates of the face centroid between the two connected cells and areas of the faces.
<br>
Test directory is in /n/swdev/LAGRIT/work/pflotran/test along with upper directory with dev work.
<br>
The routines are called from matbld 2D and 3D and use the same syntax as dump/stor and look like:
<pre>
    dump / pflotran / root_name / cmo_name
    dump / pflotran / root_name / cmo_name / nofilter_zero
</pre>
</li><li>
<b>dump / exo</b> 
<br>New code syntax using ExodusII 6.09, LaGriT commands remain the same.
<pre>
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/exodusii/files/
   Exodus II 6.09
   HDF5 version 1.8.6
   netcdf-4.1.3
</pre>
</li><li>
<b>exo block id</b> modified to single digit.
<br>
All exodus files are same as Exodus II 5, except for the block id. Tests have been updated resulting in the following differences:
<pre>
Exodus 6.09:
<               :api_version = 6.09f ;
<               :version = 6.09f ;
---
<  eb_prop1 = 1, 2, 3 ;

Exodus 5.22a:
>               :api_version = 5.22f ;
>               :version = 5.22f ;
---
>  eb_prop1 = 10000, 20000, 30000 ;
</pre>
</li>

</ul>

<p>Minor updates to master version include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>attribute compress_eps</b>
<br>
new attribute for stor file allowing user to extend range of ccoef values by
             setting mesh attribute compress_eps (from default 1e-8).
             This will keep connection regardless of coefficient value.
Changing value of compress_epsilon seemed to help loss of coeffs with large aspect ratios.
</li><li>
<b>dump / stor (2D)</b>
<br>
Corrected bug that overwrites volic with incorrect value if grid is non-planer.
</li><li>
<b>dump / fehm </b>
<br>
add space between ns and nelements, increase to i12
</li><li>
<b>read / fehm</b>
<br>
Fixed seg fault for 0 elem report message by using a,a instead of a format.
</li><li>
<b>build exodus libs</b>
<br>
The following is a list of issues when dealing with building static libraries for exodus and its compilation.
<pre>
Library inclusion order in the following places:
1. /n/swdev/src/exodusii/exodus-6.09/exodus/cbind/CMakeList.txt 
    Line 284
2. /n/swdev/src/exodusoo/exodus-6.09/exodus/forbind/CMakeList.txt
    Line 62
Solution was to switch ${HDF5_LIBRARY} with ${HDF5HL_LIBRARY}
</pre>
</li>

</pre>

</p>

<p>This release include the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<br><li><b>read / zone|zone_element / </b>
<div>
Added option zone_element which 
allows reading of node or element list in FEHM zone or zonn format.
Each node or element number found in the list has attribute tagged.
</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This release include the following fixes:</p>
<ul>
<br><li><b>#105: addatt/ mo_tri / unit_area_normal </b> 
<div>
Fixed incorrect zero result and 
fixed attribute handling so vector array is formed using irank = 3.
</div>
</li>

<br><li><b>#108: cmo/addatt/mo/area_normal/xyz/att_v_area  </b>
<div>
Result is off by factor of 2,
  fixed area normal to assign half the cross product (for triangles).
</div>
</li>

<br><li><b>#132: synth_norm </b> 
<div>
Fixed handling of attributes.
  The synthetic normals were creating a dummy attribute not used because
  offsetsurf is creating x_n_norm y_n_norm z_n_norm on the input cmo.
  Attribute names are ignored on the command line, added better reporting
  for this.
</div>

<h2>LaGriT V3.001 August 2011 </h2>
<p>Major changes incoporating work from Andrew Kuprat (64bit work) and summer student Adam Cozzette to add more capability.
Changes to make 64bit code more consistent and easier to modify for various platforms. 
The code for stack routines are combined into stack_options.f from temptam.f and read_trilayers.f.
The beads algorithm and routines are now all in their
own file beads_ona_ring.f
<br>
<br>
LaGriT assumes that the size of an integer is the same size as a
pointer.  Use the preprocessor and configure settings to select
the integer type so that it matches the size of a pointer.
<pre>
#if SIZEOF_INT == SIZEOF_VOIDP
#define int_ptrsize int
#elif SIZEOF_LONG == SIZEOF_VOIDP
#define int_ptrsize long

Makefile changes for 64 bit compile:
  -fcray-pointer
Enables the Cray pointer extension, which provides a C-like pointer

-falign-commons (will try to reorder commons so this is not needed)
By default, gfortran enforces proper alignment of all variables in a COMMON block by padding them as needed. On certain platforms this is mandatory, on others it increases performance. If a COMMON block is not declared with consistent data types everywhere, this padding can cause trouble, and -fno-align-commons can be used to disable automatic alignment. The same form of this option should be used for all files that share a COMMON block. To avoid potential alignment issues in COMMON blocks, it is recommended to order objects from largests to smallest.

</pre>


</pre>

</p>

<p>Andrew Kuprat changes:
<ul>
<pre>
filterkd.f - new filter command (called with 'filterkd') uses kd-tree for filter.
msgtty.f - added command 'filterkd'
reverseform.f - necessary for filterkd.f
readgmv_binary.f - Changed gmv routines so read/write gmv works on 64-bit
dumpgmv_hybrid.f - Changed gmv routines so read/write gmv works on 64-bit
Makefile.depends - updated for filterkd, reverseform
</pre>

</ul>
<br>

<p>Adam Cozzette changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
anothermatbld3d.c
<pre>
    - added several functions for computing the hybrid point of a control volume:
      tetisOnBoundary, intersectSegmentWithFace, getHybridPoint
    - added helper functions for computing dot products and distances.
    - changed the areaOf3dTriangle function to compute a vector area rather than a scalar.
    - a change computes a unit vector in the direction of an edge between
      two points in the tetrahedral mesh. We dot this with the facet of the Voronoi
      cell in order to consider just the component of the area that is in the
      direction of the edge.
    - changed the parameter list for initialize3ddiffusionmat_ so that the
      function also takes arrays for jtet, pmbndry, ifhybrid, and hybridfactor.
      ifhybrid indicates whether to use hybrid volumes and hybrid_factor is an
      attribute that the function will fill in order to indicate the extent to which
      each cell is hybridized
    - added function prototypes so that gcc can perform type checking
    - added #if to match format string to size of integers being used
</pre>

</li><li>
anothermatbld3d_wrapper.f
<pre>
    - changed subroutine call to add hybrid_factor
             subroutine anothermatbld3d_wrapper
-     x           (ifile,io_type,num_area_coef,ifcompress)
+     x           (ifile,io_type,num_area_coef,ifcompress, ifhybrid)
</pre>

</li><li>
cmo_addatt.f
<pre>
    - added the hybrid_volume to the cmo // addatt command
    - added a metric for quad quality  cmo // addatt / quad_quality
</pre>

</li><li>
connect2d_lg.f
<pre>
    - fix bug in 2D delaunay connect where the code
      doubled the coordinates of the first Voronoi point
</pre>

</li><li>
cr_copy.f
<pre>
    - fixed an off-by-one error by making an array one element longer
      in a call to mmgetblk with length + 1
      this was causing segfault errors
</pre>

</li><li>
dumpfehm.f
<pre>
    - changed subroutine call to add hybrid_factor
       subroutine dumpfehm(ifile,ifileini,ioption,iomode,
-     *       area_coef_option,compress_opt,attrib_option,area_option)
+     *       area_coef_option,compress_opt,attrib_option,area_option,
+     *       hybrid_option)
</pre>

</li><li>
eset.f
<pre>
    - Added support for writing element sets out to a file based on pset logic
      changed the behavior so that eltset // write will write each element set
      to a separate file if it is given the -all- option
      filenames now end with .cellset
    - fixed a bug where attempting to redefine an element set, the set is now
      zeroed out and written afresh
</pre>

</li><li>
geniee.f
<pre>
    - changed loop to check condition before starting, this avoids
      writing to memory is invalid
</pre>

</li><li>
intersect_cmo.f
<pre>
    - added sort // line_graph after performing the intersection
    - fixed loop that was looping wrong number of times
      changed 1,npointsa to 1,npoint
</pre>

</li><li>
pcc_test.f
<pre>
    - fixed Warning so it is given once instead of once for every element
</pre>

</li><li>
pset.F
<pre>
    - changed pset to verify a point before writing to file
    - added the -all- option that writes each pset to seperate files
      with the new file extension .vertexset
</pre>

</li><li>
quality.f
<pre>
    - Added support for quad metrics in quality / quad
</pre>

</li><li>
reorder.f
<pre>
    - fixed reorder so that it doesn't rely on the numerical values
      to determine whether to sort nodes or elements
    - added messages to indicate possible WARNINGS for reorder
</pre>

</li><li>
rotatelo.f
<pre>
    - Fixed a bug whereby rotateln would rotate some points in one
      direction and some points in the opposite direction.
</pre>

</li><li>
sortbins.f
<pre>
    - Added support for sort // line_graph. line_graph_sort.cpp does most of the
      real work. I also had to fix this subroutine to create the sort keys correctly.
      Previously it used an integer length to decide whether to use 'nnodes' or
      'nelements', but now it is careful to choose based on whether it is actually
      sorting nodes or elements.
</pre>

</li><li>
sparseMatrix.c
<pre>
    - removed unused variables in order to get rid of compiler warnings
    - added #if for printf to use string according to integer size
</pre>

</li><li>
writedump.f
<pre>
    - changes to facilitate the 'hybrid' option and Rao's new dump / exo code
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
</ul>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The next release, expected in
early 2011, will have 64 bit memory pointers. This will allow access to
much more real and virtual memory so that the present limitations on
memory and mesh size that can be built and manipulated will be greatly
expanded.<br>

 name="dump__zone_outside__..."></a><b><b>dump / zone_outside / ...<br>
      </b></b></h4>
Changed FEHM outside area calculation to default to Voronoi area
associated with nodes of a 3D tetrahedral mesh instead of computing
Median area. FEHM file file_root_outside.area changed to
file_root_outside_vor.area For dump/zone, added keywords keepatt_area
or keepatt_voronoi which will compute and keep voronoi vector areas
xn_varea, yn_varea, zn_varea and keepatt_median will compute area/num
nodes on face and keep attributes xn_area, yn_area, zn_area The written
file file_root_outside_vor.area or file_name_outside_med.area is a list
of 2D area vectors (Ax_i,Ay_i,Az_i) associated with each node. <a

      </b></b></h4>
This module will do the same voronoi calculation on triangles as is
done with the outside area for a 3D tetrahderal mesh. The call will
create vector components for each node and fill the node attributes
xn_varea, yn_varea, zn_varea. <a

      </b></b></h4>
Now creates attributes to hold element local face numbers of 3D input
mesh that occur on either side of output mesh face, idface0 and
idface1. Now copies user-created node-based attributes from source mesh
into extracted sink mesh. <a

      <h4 style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><a
 name="addmesh__excavate__..."></a><b><b>addmesh / excavate / ...</b></b></h4>
excavate - remove nodes and elements if they fall with the circumsphere
of triangles on the input mesh.<br>
      <br>
mesh1 must be a 3D mesh (of any geometry) and mesh2 must be a 2D
triangular mesh. This command then excavates a volume in mesh1 around
mesh2, such that the surface could then be inserted into the 3D mesh
(such as to insert a fault into a background terrain mesh). The
background mesh, minus the excavated/removed nodes, is put into mesh3.
If the optional [bfs] argument is given, the routine will use a
breadth-first search algorithm to find nodes to remove, as opposed to
the default KD-tree algorithm. If the optional [connect] argument is
given, the program will, after excavation, execute an addmesh/append,
and then a connect, to produce a fully connected mesh with the surface
(mesh2) inserted into the background (mesh1). <a

      <h4 style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><a
 name="interpolate__..."></a><b><b>interpolate / ...<br>
      </b></b></h4>
Changed interpolate to "find" more points on edges this will permit
nodes to find a nearest edge or point and be "inside" the triangle for
extreme small or large numbers where epsilon values are difficult to
evaluate correctly. Note, this changed test results for interpolate,
test/level01 results were updated for these improvements. <a
 href="https://lagrit.lanl.gov/docs/main_interpolate.html">https://lagrit.lanl.gov/docs/main_interpolate.html</a><br>
      <br>
intrp_gtg.f<br>
A bug was fixed in interpolation that would sometimes save
a node id in pt_gtg or el_gtg attributes that was not related
to the found candidate and value. This could occur where there are
multiple candidates for the source and if epsilon values are near
machine limits. The test in level01/intrp_2D_sizes
was changed to capture and evaluate these issues.<br>
      <br>
intrp_gtg.f, inside_lg.f<br>
There are changes to interpolate using tests for finding points
that are inside or on edges or vertices of an element. The epsilon
tests have been relaxed to allow points that are "near" to be
found on edge - if within the chosen epsilon. The interpolation
has been changed to evaluate candidate points based on the
confidence of being inside the associated triangle. A result
indicating the point is inside will "win" over a candidate result
that is on edge or vertice. If idebug attribute is set to a
number of 5 or greater, there will be many more statements
written that are related to the inside triangle and epsilon
tests.<br>

Substantial changes and additions to DUMP2.html which describes
all the dump file_types and include more descriptions of FEHM files.

linear_extrapolate - keyword for an extrapolation from an attribute
value in a surface onto every node of a 3D mesh. Given a 3D mesh and a
2D surface, this command will extrapolate a scalar value from that
surface onto every point of the mesh. This can be used to (for example):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Propogate head values from a surface onto all
nodes of a mesh.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Expand a mesh to fit a surface, by propogating the
appropriate spatial coordinate.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Compute the depth relative to a topographic
surface to each node of a mesh. <a
