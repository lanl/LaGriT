> **_SETPTS_**

Sets point types and material regions by calling** surfset **and** regset**
routines.** **Generate constraint table. The material (imt1) attribute is set
based on the **mregion** commands. Interior and external boundary nodes should
be assigned to exactly one **mregion**; these nodes will be assigned an
**imt1** value that corresponds to the **mregion.** A node which is on an
interface will be assigned to any** mregion **and will be given an **imt1**
value of "**interface**" (an integer equal to one more than the number of
material regions.) Node types are assigned based on whether a node is on a
surface and what type the surface(s) is.

This command must be executed before **connect.** FORMAT: **setpts**

**setpts/no_interface**   
This allows one to set the imt values of nodes without getting any nodes
labeled imt=interface. This is useful if you do not want settets to create
parent child chains at interface points. The actual imt value given may be
determined by roundoff error so should not be used in cases where there are a
large number of interface points.&nbsp_place_holder; It is useful for setting
imt values of an rzbrick mesh in which interface points only occur due to the
coincidental point very near the geometry defining surface.

**setpts**/**closed_surfaces**/**reflect**   
The **closed_surfaces** option works with geometries in which all regions and
mregions are defined by closed surfaces. The nodes that fall on more than one
surface are labeled as interface nodes. Nodes which fall on exactly one
surface are labeled external reflective boundary nodes. Nodes which are
external boundary interface nodes are not labeled correctly and
**resetpts/itp** must be called to correct the point types. An input file
using the closed_surfaces option might look like: cmo/create/s1///tri
