>> This command is a macro command that calculates the radial distance from a
specified point to a set of points. That set of points can be defined using
the standard LaGriT syntax of psets and range. If the specification for a set
of points is omitted, the whole grid is used. The command operates on the
current mesh object.

>>

>> This operation will (often) result in two attributes being added to the
current mesh object. The first, a real named rdist, contains the radial
distance from the point of interest. The second, an integer named ictrpt,
contains an index that specifies the center point that was used for this
calculation.

>> **calc_rdist**/x0,y0,z0/[radius_index]/[**pset,get,**pset_name|ifirst,ilast
,istride]

>>

>> x0,y0,z0 are the coordinates of the center point used in the calculation.

radius_index is an optional integer. It serves as an index for a specific
center point.&nbsp_place_holder; Its value is placed in the attribute

ictrpt throughout the range affected by the command. If it is not specified,
no changes are made to the attribute ictrpt. The non-value for this attribute
is 0 (i.e., if there is no radius index, the value of ictrpt will be 0).

>>

>> The last argument that **calc_rdist** takes specifies the range over which
the command will be executed. If it is omitted, the whole grid is assumed.

> EXAMPLES:

>

>> **calc_rdist/**0,0,0

>>

>>> This command would calculate the distance from the origin to all points in
the mesh, and place the values in rdist. It would not modify ictrpt in any
way.

>>

>> **calc_rdist**/1,0.25,1/10/pset,get,big_sphere

>>

>>> This command would calculate the distance from the point 1,0.25,1 to all
the points within the pset big_sphere. It would place those distances into
rdist within that pset, and would replace the value of ictrpt with 10 within
that pset as well.
