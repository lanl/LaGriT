> > **setsize** will set the mesh object attributes
xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,zmin,zmax from the xic,yic,zic values of all 'real' points
(dudded and merged points will be ignored).&nbsp_place_holder; It also sets
epsilon, epsilona and epsilonv as follows:&nbsp_place_holder; setsize is
called internally by LaGriT commands that add nodes to the
mesh;**[copypts](COPYPTS.html)**,**[ createpts](createpts.html)**,
**[regpnts](REGNPTS.html)**, **[recon](RECON.html)**,**[scale](SCALE.html)**,
**[translate](TRANS.html)**

epsilonv=abs(xmax-xmin)*abs(ymax-ymin)*abs(zmax-zmin)*epsilonr*1000.

epsilona=((xmax-xmin)**2+(ymax-ymin)**2+(zmax-zmin)**2)*epsilonr*1000.

epsilonr is set at initialization time by:

>>

>>> > > x2=one

do i=1,1000

>>>>>

>>>>>> x2=x2/two

x1=one+x2

if(x1.le.one) go to 11

>>>>>

>>>>> enddo

11 epsilonr=x2*2.

where the values of 'one' and 'two' are obtained from the include file
'consts.h'.

The command**[ cmo/printatt ](cmo/cmo_printatt.html)**can be used to view any
of these cmo attributes:

e.g. **cmo/printatt**//**xmax**

The programmer interface is the subroutine setsize (see Section e.7)

The variables epsilonl, epsilona and epsilonv are mesh object attributes;
hence they may be different for all meshes in a given run.&nbsp_place_holder;
epsilona, epsilonv and epsilon1 may be set by the user with the
**[cmo/setatt](cmo/cmo_setatt.html)** command.&nbsp_place_holder; They also
will be written to LaGriT dumps and subsequently will be read in at restart.
The variables in consts.h (epsilon and epsilonr) are machine and run
dependent. They are not written to LaGriT dumps and there is only one copy per
run.

&nbsp_place_holder; FORMAT: **setsize**

if epsilonv is very small epislonvis set to epsilona

epsilon1 is set by a call to set_epsilon

epsilon1 is set to the square root of epsilona unless this number would be too
small in which case epsilon1 is to (( xmax-xmin) + (ymax-ymin) + (zmax-zmin))
* 1.e=8/3

Many LaGriT algorithms use epsilon1; for example, if a node falls on a
interface or boundary surface.&nbsp_place_holder; It uses epsilonv to
determine if a node can be connected.&nbsp_place_holder; Errors from
**setpts** and **connect** may result if inconsistant or wrong values of
epsilons are used.
