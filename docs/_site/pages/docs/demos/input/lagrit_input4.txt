*
* Create a cmo with hexahedral storage arrays
cmo/create/cmo/ / / hex
* Define the exterior and a plane
surface/cube/reflect/box/0.0,0.0,0.0/1.0,1.0,1.0/
surface/cutplane/intrface/plane/0.,0.,.1/1.,0.,.5/1.,1.,.8
* Define the material regions
mregion/mattop/le cube and gt cutplane/
mregion/matbot/le cube and lt cutplane
* Create a rectangular grid
creatpts/brick/xyz/21,5,41/0.,0.,0./1.,1.,1./1 1 1
*rzbrick/xyz/21,5,41/0.,0.,0./1.,1.,1./1 1 1
* Color the nodes according to the mregions
setpts
* Color the elements according to the mregions
settets
* Output the final grid
