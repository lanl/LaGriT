 Example 1: reconnect points in a 2d geometry

  The objective is to reconnect a set of existing nodes (2
  dimensional) using the command **recon**. The command rearranges connections in the mesh to ensure that the Delaunay criterion is satisfied, or to
  improve triangle shapes.
  The output consists of two gmv files. Output1a.gmv is the input
  mesh, and output1b.gmv is the reconnected mesh.
