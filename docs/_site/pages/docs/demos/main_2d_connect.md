## Examples:  connect 2D

The objective is to connect a set of random points into a triangle mesh.

1. Create a mesh object named mo_tri and create a set of random points within a box.
2. Connect and Set node itp to mark boundary nodes.
3. Check mesh quality and write mesh file.
 
### Input Commands

```
# create a 2D mesh object
# triplane has ndimensions_topo=2 and ndimensions_geom=2 
cmo / create / mo_tri / / / triplane

# Make some points at the four corners
createpts / xyz / 5 5 1 / 0. 0. 0. / 1. 1. 0. / 1 1 1

# Add some random points and delete duplicate points
createpts / random / xyz / 0.4 / 0.1 0.1 0. / 0.9 0.9 0.
filter / 1 0 0
rmpoint / compress

# set some defaults for the connect routine
# imt material set to 1 and itp boundaries set to 0
cmo / setatt / mo_tri / imt / 1 0 0 / 1
cmo / setatt / mo_tri / itp / 1 0 0 / 0

connect

# set default materials and boundary tags
cmo / setatt / mo_tri / itetclr / 1 0 0 / 1
resetpts / itp

# check areas and write an AVS format file of the mesh
quality
dump / avs / tri.inp / mo_tri
```

### Output from quality command 

This quality report confirms all areas are positive and the triangles do not have small aspect ratios.

*Note this old example is non-convex and has long tets outside the boundary that need to be removed.*
