 **3. Define interior interfaces**

Interfaces are defined with the **[surface](commands/SURFACE.md)**
command. In this case the boundary type is **intrface**. If the command
defines a volume (e.g. box, cylinder) then the interface is the surface
of the volume defined. If the command defines a plane or sheet then the
interface is the plane or sheet. It is important to remember that planes
are infinite and that the order of points specifying the plane
determines a normal to the plane in the usual right-hand-rule sense
([see Section II.a.9](conventions.md)). This direction is important in
determining regions. In order to divide the unit cube defined above in
half vertically, define a plane by:

**surface**/cutplane**/intrface** **/plane**/0.,0.,.5/1.,0.,.5/1.,1.,.5

The normal to this plane points in the positive z direction.

Interfaces must not be coincident with reflective boundaries. For
example to embed a rectangle inside a cube, it is necessary to extend
the ends of the rectangle beyond the cube to avoid coincident reflective
and interface surfaces:

**surface**/cube**/reflect** **/box**/0.0,0.0,0.0/1.0,1.0,1.0

**surface**/rect **/intrface/box**/-0.1,0.5,0.2/1.1,0.6,0.5
