**7. Connect the points into tetrahedra**

The mesh designer may use the following set of command to connect the
points into a tetrahedral mesh:

* eliminate coincident or nearly coincident points

* 1,0,0 means consider all points

**[filter](commands/FILTER.md)/1,0,0**/

* rayend points are set to invisible (21 is the code for invisible)

* they were used as end points of the rays in the regnpts command

**[cmo](commands/cmo/cmo_setatt.md)/setatt//itp/pset,get,rayend/21**/

* assign material colors to the points

* identify points that are on material interfaces

* identify constrained points

**[setpts](commands/SETPTS.md)**

* connect the points into a Delaunay tetrahedral mesh

* do not connect across material interfaces - add points if necessary
o resolve material interfaces

**[connect](commands/CONNECT1.md)**

* set element (tetrahedral) color

* spawn child points at material interfaces

**[settets](commands/SETTETS.md)**

* dump mesh to some output form

**dump** **/gmv**/filename

* terminate processing

**[finish](commands/FINISH.md)**

The complete input for the tutorial is:

    * create a 3D tetrahedral mesh object and name it *3dmesh*
    **cmo/create**/3dmesh/
    * unit cube
    **surface**/cube**/reflect** **/box**/0.0,0.0,0.0/1.0,1.0,1.0/
    * define z=.5 plane as interface
    **surface** /cutplane**/intrface/plane/0.,0.,.5/1.,0.,.5/1.,1.,.5**/
    *define geometric regions
    **region**/top**/ le** cube **and gt** cutplane ** ** /
    **region**/bottom**/ le** cube **and le** cutplane /
    *** define material regions**
    **mregion**/mattop**/ le** cub**e and gt** cutplane /
    **mregion**/matbot**/ le** cube **and lt** cutplane /
    * create 25 points (5x5x1) in a plane above the unit cube
    * place points on the boundaries in the x and y directions (1,1,0)
    **createpts/xyz**/5,5,1/0.,0.,1.1/1.,1.,1.1/1,1,0/
    * give the points defined by the createpts command the name, rayend
    **pset**/rayend**/seq**/1,0,0/
    * create rays between points in rayend and the plane below the cube
    * distribute 3 points along these rays in the region top
    * add one point at the upper external boundary for each ray
    **regnpts**/top/3**/pset**,**get**,rayend**/xyz**/0.,0.,-.1/0.,1.,-.1/1.,1.,-.1/0,0/
    * distribute 4 points along these rays in the region *bottom*
    * add one point at the lower external boundary for each ray
    * add one point at the material interface for each ray since
    * *bottom* contains the interface - a total of 5 points for each ray.
    * points will be distributed such that the ratio of distances between
    * any two consecutive pairs of points is 0.6 traveling from the source
    * of the ray (the plane) to the ray end.
    **regnpts**/bottom/4**/pset**,**get**,rayend**/xyz**/0.,0.,-.1/0.,1.,-.1/1.,1.,-.1/1,.6/
    * eliminate coincident or nearly coincident points
    * 1,0,0 means consider all points
    **filter/1,0,0**/
    * rayend points are set to invisible (21 is the code for invisible)
    * they were used as end points of the rays in the regnpts command
    **cmo/setall//itp/pset,get,**rayend/21** **/
    * assign material colors to the points
    * identify points that are on material interfaces
    * identify constrained points
    **setpts**
    * connect the points into a Delaunay tetrahedral mesh
    * do not connect across material interfaces -
    * add points if necessary to resolve material interfaces
    **connect**
    * set element (tetrahedral) type
    **settets**
    * dump mesh to some output form
    **dump/gmv**/filename
    * terminate processing
    **finish**
