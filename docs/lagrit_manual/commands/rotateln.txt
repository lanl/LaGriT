> **_ROTATELN_**

>

>> Rotates a point distribution (specified by ifirst,ilast,istride) about a
line. The **copy** option allows the user to make a copy of the original
points as well as the rotated points, while **nocopy** just keeps the rotated
points themselves. The line of rotation defined by x1 through z2 needs to be
defined such that the endpoints extend beyond the point distribution being
rotated. theta (in degrees) is the angle of rotation whose positive direction
is determined by the right-hand-rule, that is, if the thumb of your right hand
points in the direction of the line (1 to 2), then your fingers will curl in
the direction of rotation. xcen,ycen,zcen is the point where the line can be
shifted to before rotation takes place.

If the **copy **option is chosen, the new points will have only coordinate
values (**xic, yic**, **zic**); no values will be set for any other mesh
object attribute for these points.

>>

>> Note:&nbsp_place_holder; The end points of the&nbsp_place_holder; line
segment must extend well beyond the point set being rotated.

&nbsp_place_holder; EXAMPLE:

> * input.cylrot use rotateln and trans to move cylinder

* create a cylinder centered around&nbsp_place_holder; x=.5,z=.5, radius = .1   
* the cylinder is aligned parallel to the y-axis.   
* inside a box of width =2 , length=2 ,height=1   
* the regions are air for the cylinder - solid outside the cyl.   
* points are spread by surrounding the whole object with   
* a cylinder shell of points and then creating rays between   
* these points and the major axis of the cylinder.&nbsp_place_holder; Points   
* are distributed along these rays inside the cylindrical region.   
* a background rectangular grid of points is spread outside the   
* cylinder.
