>> This routine defines a local coordinate system to be in effect until
another coordinate system is defined or the normal coordinate system is reset.
The new coordinate system is defined by specifying an origin, a point on the
new x-z plane and a point on the new z-axis. These points are specified in the
normal coordinate system. The options available in iopt are:

>>

>>> **define** define a new local coordinate system

**normal** return to the normal coordinate system   
**save** save the current coordinate system for recall   
**restore** recall the last saved coordinate system

> FORMAT:

>

>> **coordsys**/iopt/x0,y0,z0/xx,xy,xz/zx,zy,zz

where x0,y0,z0 is the location of the new origin, xx,xy,xz is a point on the
new x-z plane and zx,zy,zz is a point on the new z-axis. These points are
defined with the normal coordinate system, and used only with the **define**
option.
