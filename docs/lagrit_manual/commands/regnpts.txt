>> Generates points in a region previously defined by the region command. The
points are generated by shooting rays through a user specified set of points
from an origin point, line, or plane and finding the intersection of each ray
with the surfaces that define the region. The point distribution is determined
by the data in ptdist. If ptdist is integer, then that many points are evenly
distributed along the ray in the region. If ptdist is real, then points are
distributed at that distance along the ray, up to a maximum of maxpenetr
points along the ray (in addition to any interface points that may be
created). note: If the ray encounters a region more than once, multiple sets
of points are layed down. Points are distributed on the regionis material
interfaces and external boundaries if the region definition includes the
interfaces or boundaries -- usually **ge** or **le** means that the region
includes the interface or boundary.

Only surface intersection points are created if ptdist is **inside**, **in**,
**out**, **outside**, or**both****. **In this case, surface points are created
regardless of region ownership of the interface or boundary surface -- if a
ray encounters a region more than once, the appropriate surface intersection
point(s) is generated for each encounter.

If another region intrudes upon the regnpts region so that the regpts region
is divided into more than one piece, points that fall inside the intruding
region are not distributed.

The variables irratio and rrz determine ratio zoning when ptdist is an
integer. Ratio zoning is on when irratio is 1; the point distribution is
adjusted so that the ratio between successive pairs of points is rrz. When
irratio is 3, ratio zoning is calculated on the longest ray; then this length
distribution is applied to all rays.

See the description of the command **surface **for a discussion of point
distributions with respect to sheet surfaces.
