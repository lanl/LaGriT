> **_SURFACE_**

Defines a boundary surface of the type specified in ibtype.

Releases a previously defined surface.

ibtype can be **free**, **intrface**, **reflect, intrcons **or** virtual**.
Use **reflect **or **free** for external boundaries, **intrface** for interior
interfaces, **intrcons** for constrained interior interfaces. Use **virtual**
for virtual interfaces.&nbsp_place_holder; Nodes on **reflect**, **intrcons**,
or **virtual&nbsp_place_holder; **interfaces will be assigned icrl values
corresponding to the surfaces on which the nodes sit. The command **settets
**will generate parent/child node chains (isn1) for nodes on **intrface** or
**intrcons. **Surfaces which have different materials on either side of the
surface virtual interfaces do not separate material regions but are intended
to identify other structural features of a geometry.&nbsp_place_holder; The
surface is defined by a set of surface-parameters.

istype can be **plane**, **box,** **parallel**(piped), **sphere**,
**cylinder**, **cone**, **ellipse**(oid), **tabular** (rotated tabular
profile), or **sheet**. Surface-parameters are specified with the surface type
in mind.

isurname is the name of the surface and must be unique for each surface
defined by **surface**. FORMAT: **surface**/isurname/ibtype/istype/surface-
parameters

**surface**/isurname/ibtype/**sheet**/cmo-name   
**surface**/isurname/**release** EXAMPLES: **surface**/s1/**release**   
Release the previously defined surface named s1.&nbsp_place_holder; Remove all
references from the geometry data structures and remove all constraints
associated with this surface.

**surface**/sbox/ibtype/**box**/xmin,ymin,zmin/xmax,ymax,zmax/   
Where xmin,ymin,zmin and xmax,ymax,zmax are the coordinates of opposite
corners of a cube, i.e bottom left and top right corners.

**surface**/mysurf/ibtype/**cone**/x1,y1,z1/x2,y2,z2/radius/   
Where point 1 is the vertex and point 2 is the top center of the cone with
radius from that point. A cone is finite but open. To create a closed cone cap
the open end with a plane.

**surface**/acyl/ibtype/**cylinder**/x1,y1,z1/x2,y2,z2/radius   
Where point 1 is the bottom center and point 2 is the top center of the
cylinder. radius is the radius of the cylinder. Cylinders are open but
finite.&nbsp_place_holder; To create a closed cylinder cap both ends with
planes.

**surface**/sellip/ibtype/**ellipse**/x1,y1,z1/x2,y2,z2/x3,y3,z3/ar,br,cr/   
Where point 1 is the center of the ellipsoid and point 2 is on the a semi-axis
(new x), point 3 is on the b semi-axis (new y), and ar, br, cr are radii on
their respective semi-axes.

**surface**/s2/ibtype/**parallel**/x1,y1,z1/x2,y2,z2/x3,y3,z3/x4,y4,z4/   
Where points 1, 2, 3 are the front left, front right and back left points of
the base and point 4 is the upper left point of the front face.

**surface**/s1/ibtype/**plane**/x1,y1,z1/x2,y2,z2/x3,y3,z3   
**surface**/top/ibtype/**planexyz**/x1,y1,z1/x2, z2/x3,y3,z3   
the direction of the normal to the plane is determined by the order of the
points according to the right hand rule.

**surface**/s10/ibtype/**planertp**/radius1,theta1,p   
**surface**/asheet/ibtype/**sheet**/cmo_name/<   
Sheet surfaces may be input by specifying a cmo_name. The Mesh Object must be
either a 2D quad Mesh Object or a 2D triangle Mesh Object. A discussion of
inside and outside with respect to sheet surfaces is presented after the
EXAMPLES section.

Where point 1 and point 2 define the axis of rotation for the tabular profile
with point 1 as the origin. This is followed by pairs of profile descriptors
depending on the value of geom.Ifgeom is set to **rz**, then the r value is a
radius normal to the axis of rotation and z is the distance along the new axis
of rotation. If geomis set to **rt** then theta is the angle from the axis of
rotation at point 1 andris the distance from point 1 along theta. The first
pair must start on a new line and all lines must contain pairs of data. The
last pair of data must be followed by end.

**Inside/outside **with respect to** sheet surfaces** will be determined by the following algorithm: * For the point being considered, p, find the nearest sheet triangle and the closest point, q, to p that lies on that triangle.

* Construct the vector![](../Image255.gif), from q to p.

* Construct the outward normal to the triangle,&nbsp_place_holder;![](../Image256.gif). The outward normal is constructed using the right hand rule and the order of the points in the sheet. Sheets may be specified as quad Mesh Object (i.e. a 2 dimensional array of points containing the coordinates of the corners of each quad). Either two triangles (divide each quad in two using point (i,j) and (i+1,j+1)) or four triangles (add a point in the center of the quad) are generated by each quad. Applying the right hand rule to the points (i,j), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1) gives the direction of the normal for all triangles created from the quad.

* If&nbsp_place_holder;![](../Image255.gif)*&nbsp_place_holder;![](../Image256.gif)< 0 then the point is inside. If&nbsp_place_holder;![](../Image255.gif)*&nbsp_place_holder;![](../Image256.gif)>0 the point is outside. If&nbsp_place_holder;![](../Image255.gif)![](../Image256.gif)* n = 0, and if p is on the triangle then p=q and p in on the triangle.

* If&nbsp_place_holder;![](../Image255.gif)*![](../Image256.gif) = 0 and p is not on the triangle then p is outside. ![](../new_html/Image257.gif)

One implication of this definition is that the concept of shadows cast by open
sheets no longer is valid. Sheets may be considered to extend to the boundary
of the geometry.
