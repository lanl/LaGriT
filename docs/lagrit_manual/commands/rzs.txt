Builds a sphere by generating coordinates of points and also modifies zoning
by ratio-zoning point distributions. See the** rz **command for more details.
The** **itype flag defines what type of sphere will be generated.

itype=1 generates a sphere by gridding the faces of a cube and then projecting
the vertices onto a sphere. The number of nodes per shell is of the form
6*i**2.

itype=2 generates a sphere by subdividing an icosahedron placed on the surface
of a sphere.

Icosahedralm gridding is made up of 10 diamonds per shell. Each diamond is
made up of n**2 nodes (where n must be of the form 2**i+1). There are 2 nodes
(the poles of the sphere) at which 5 diamonds meet and 10 nodes where 3
diamonds meet; hence there are a minimum of 12 nodes per shell. The number of
nodes per shell can be 12, 42, 162, 642,...

itype= 1 or 2 or diamond distributes points only, call **connect** to generate
connectivity information.

nr is the number of radial shells

npt is the upper limit of the number of points in a shell

itype=8 generates a hexahedral icosahedron grid. This option distributes
points and generates the grid connectivity data structures.

xirad,xorad are the inner and outer radii of the sphere. For itype=8 reverse
inner and outer radii.

xcen,ycen,zcen are the coordinates of the center of the sphere

iz&nbsp_place_holder; if =0 then mins and maxs are used as cell centers

irat is ratio zoning switch (0=off,1=on)

rz is ratio zoning value - distance is multiplied by the value for each
subsequent point.

itype = diamond generates the points for one diamond of the icosahedron
