> **add** - Find the intersection of mesh1 and mesh2. Refine mesh1 where it
overlaps mesh2 using the following criteria. refine_factor specifies the
number of times that the background mesh will be refined. If this number is
negative, or if it does not appear, then the it will use the default. The
default method determines the number of refinement iterations based on the
volumes of the tets. It continues to refine until the elements on the
interface boundary of the background mesh object are within a given factor
(5.0) of the volume of the elements on the border of the incoming mesh object.
This factor is a parameter constant called size_difference in the code
continue_refinement.f. For example, if size_difference is set to 5.0, then the
background mesh will be refined until the maximum volume element on the
boundary with the incoming mesh object is no bigger than 5 times the volume of
the maximum volume element on the border of the incoming mesh. refine_type is
the type of refinement that is executed. If the string **tet** appears, then
tetrahedral refinement is performed. Otherwise, **edge** based refinement is
performed. After the above refine steps have been done, the intersection of
mesh1 and mesh2 is found, elements that overlap are deleted from mesh1 and
mesh2 is appended to mesh1 to create mesh3.

>

> **merge** - Append mesh2 to to mesh1 and create mesh3. Essentially this just
concatenates two mesh objects.

>

> **glue** - Synonym for **merge**.

>

> **append** - Append mesh2 to mesh1 and create mesh3. Similar to **merge**
except imt, icr, itetclr of mesh2 have the value max(imt(mesh1)) added to
mesh2.

>

> **delete** - Create mesh3 which is mesh1 with elements that intersect mesh2
deleted.

>

> **intersect** - Create a pset called pset_name that contains all nodes in
mesh1 which intersect elements of mesh2.

>

> **amr** - Use Adaptive mesh refinement to connect background mesh1 with
submesh mesh2 and create mesh3.

>

> **match** - Same as **merge** except the second mesh can be moved, rotated
and translated. The first mesh does not move scale or rotate. If the interface
needs to be scaled, translated and rotated that is accomplished by specifing 3
node numbers in each mesh or 3 node coordinates from each mesh that are to
become coincident. If nodes are given match i1-i4, i2-i5, i3-i6. If
coordinates are given match (x1,y1,z1)-(x4,y4,z4), etc.

>

> **pyramid** - join a hex mesh to a tet mesh. The common surface must have
matching nodes (i.e. there must be exactly two triangle faces on the tet grid
that fit into one quad face of the hex grid). Pyramid elements will be
constructed in the region where the two meshes join.

>

> **excavate** - mesh1 must be a 3D mesh (of any geometry) and mesh2 must be a
2D triangular mesh. This then excavates an area in mesh1 around mesh2, such
that the surface could then be inserted into the 3D mesh (such as to insert a
fault into a background terrain mesh). The background mesh, minus the
excavated/removed nodes, is put into mesh3. If the optional [bfs] argument is
given, the routine will use a breadth-first search algorithm to find nodes to
remove, as opposed to the default KD-tree algorithm. If the optional [connect]
argument is given, the program will, after excavation, execute an
addmesh/append, and then a connect, to produce a fully connected mesh with the
surface (mesh2) inserted into the background (mesh1).

> NOTE: Care must be taken when using these commands because nothing is done
to clean up the point type (itp) array after the **addmesh** operation. The
user must often execute a series of [**resetpts**/**itp**](RESETPT.html) and
**[filter](FILTER.html)** commands to get the final desired result.
