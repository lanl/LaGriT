 **Tutorial -- Generating Initial Grids Using the LaGriT Command
 Language:**

 The steps involved in generating three dimensional grids in the
 LaGriT command language are:
 
1. [Define mesh objects.](definemo.md)

2. [Define an enclosing volume](defineev.md).

3. [Define interior interfaces.](DEFINEII.md)

4. [Divide the enclosing volume into
 regions.](dividereg.md)

5. [Assign material types to the regions.](assignmt.md)

6. [Distribute points within the
 volume.](distributep.md)

7. [Connect the points into
 tetrahedra](connecttet.md)

Detailed descriptions of the LaGriT commands are given in Section II.
This tutorial covers just the commands needed to generate a simple
grid. The tutorial will explain how to generate a grid in a unit cube
containing two materials separated by a plane. Lines that begin with
an asterisk (
*) are comments; keywords are in **bold**.
