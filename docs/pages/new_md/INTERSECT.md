 **INTERSECT**

  Creates a new Mesh Object from the intersection of two existing Mesh
  Objects. The existing Mesh Objects have to be topologically 2D and
  geometrically 3D. The created Mesh Object will be topologically 1D
  and geometrically 3D. Node quantities for the new Mesh Object will
  be create by interpolation on the corresponding node quantities of
  the first input Mesh Object, cmo\_1\_in.

 **FORMAT**:

  **intersect**/cmo\_out/cmo\_1\_in/cmo\_2\_in
