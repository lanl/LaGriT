 Example 5: addmesh / intersect

  The objective is to create a point set that are the nodes in mesh1
  that intersect elements of mesh2.
  Two cubes defined by mesh1 and mesh2 are read. The perimeter of
  mesh2 lies within that of mesh1. The **addmesh / intersect** command
  is used to determine the nodes in mesh1 that intersect elements of
  mesh2.
