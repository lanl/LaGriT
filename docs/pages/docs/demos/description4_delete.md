 Example 4: addmesh / delete

  The objective is to create a mesh using the **addmesh/delete**
  command by  deleting one mesh from another.
  Two cubes, one smaller than the other, each having a different grid
  resolution are combined. The **delete** option finds the elements of
  mesh1 that intersect

  mesh2 and removes them from mesh1, creating the resultant mesh
  (mesh3).
