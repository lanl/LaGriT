# REFINE

---------


The refine command is used to create more elements. The method in which these new elements are formed is based on the `refine_method`
 chosen. The refine criteria used in these methods are defined at [Grid Refinement](../REFINE1.md) Section.

### Refine Methods 

**`junction`** will refine object where `field` crosses `xvalue`


**`constant`** will refine object where `field` &gt; `xvalue`


**`delta`** will refine object where delta(`field`) &gt; `xvalue`


**`lambda`** will refine object where lambda(`field`) &lt; `xvalue`


**`maxsize`** will refine object where object &gt; `xvalue`. Size refers to volume for tets, area for face, and length for edges.


**`aspect`** will refine where aspect ratio &lt; `xvalue`


**`addpts`** will refine explicitly by adding a set of nodes defined in pset,get,psetsname


**`rivara`** edges longer than `xvalue` will be refined according to the principle that a refined edge candidate is the longest edge in
     any element that contains it. This results in a recursive refinement procedure that adds neighboring edges to the refinement
     candidate list until no neighbor edge is longer then the candidate. `refine_type` must be **edge**. Arguments `field` and
     **interpolation** are ignored. This method of refinement, when used with a **pset**, produces a nicely graded mesh.


**`rivara_boundary`** applies the rivara algorithm, but will only bisect edges on external boundaries.



**`rivera_truncated`** applies the rivara algorithm, but restricts the neighborhood search to the edges in the selected **pset**. If the
     **pset** is the entire mesh, this method has the same behavior as rivara.



**`roughness`** will refine based on the distance of the endpoint of an edge to the plane determined by the synthetic normal with
     respect to a specified surface at the other endpoint of the edge.  This is intended to increase refinement on surfaces near corners
     or around sharp bends in surfaces. `xvalue` is the distance, the `surface_name` must follow the `xvalue` distance argument.


**`edge_list`** will bisect a set of edges specified by the node numbers of the endpoints of the edges. refine_type must be
     **edge** followed by a list of `end_points` making up the edge_list.


**`element_set`** or **`eltset`** will refine all elements in a specified element set. The mesh object may be tri, quad, tet or
     hex. Internally a node set will be created from the chosen elements. Because of the conversion from element set to point
     set, it is possible that some element not in the original element set will have all of its nodes as members of the internally
     constructed points set and hence will be refined. The default refine_method is **`constant`**; refine_type is element;
     inclusion_flag is **`exclusive.`** Their are no other arguments after the element set name. 


**`interface`** will bisect a set of non-interface edges of tets all of whose vertices are interface nodes. Valid only for 3D
     tetrahedral grids and is useful to 'unlock' tetrahedra that are stuck because all of their vertices lie on interface surfaces.Â 
     After the refine operation these tetrahedral will be replaced by tetrahedra containing a vertex that is not on the surface - thus
     allowing later smooth or massage operations more freedom to improve the grid.


The following are unavailable or untested:


**`spawn`** spawns new nodes at the locations given.  It finds the existing edge that is closest to the
  desired node It then refines that edge and moves the resulting node to the desired location provided that the move does not invert any elements.
 

**`cel`** calls  CEL (create on edge length).  Takes a mesh object and bisects edges that
     (i) have both endpoints in the list of selected mass points, and (ii) have length greater than TOLLENGTH.
     The process is recursive in that new nodes are added to the list of mass points, meaning that newly created edges can
   be refined until all the edges in the mesh have length  less than TOLLENGTH.  
  This    leads to recursive refinement with nondegrading element aspect ratios.


**`minsize`**, **`lambdade`**, and **`rmelements`** are no longer supported. 


### Refine Type 

refine_type specifies what object will be refined and how that object will be refined:

- **element** or **tet** in 3D will refine elements by placing a point in the center of the element.
- **element** in 2D (triangle) will refine element by refining all edges of the triangle.
- **face** in 3D will refine facets by placing a point in the center of the facet.
- **face** in 2D (triangle) will refine face by refining all edges of the face.
- **edge** will refine edges by placing a point on the midpoint of the edge.
- **faceedge** will refine facets by refining all edges of the facet.
- **tetedge** will refine elements by refining all edges of the element.


### Refine Options 

`field` must refer to a previously defined attribute of the current Mesh Object.


`interpolation` specifies how to interpolate the `field` to give `field`
values to the new nodes created. The valid types are **linear, log**, and **sinh**.


`range` is the selection of points designated by node numbers for ifirst,ilast,istride or **pset**,get,pname. 1,0,0 will select all
nodes in the Mesh object.


`xvalue` [/`xvalue2/xvalue3`/] is the real number usually indicating a size for the different refine methods. Most of the refine methods do not
use the second and third values so their argument positions will be empty ///.


`inclusion_flag` is an optional flag specifing if refinement is an inclusive or an exclusive operation. By default, all operations are
exclusive. For inclusive, if an edge refinement is specified restricted to a **pset**, then an edge is eligible for refinement if either
or both of the end points belong to the **pset** selected. If the `inclusion_flag` is exclusive then both end points must be in the
**pset**. The implemented values are **inclusive** and **exclusive**. 



## QUADTREE and OCTREE REFINEMENT

Quad and hexahedral elements may be refined creating quad tree and octree meshes. Three new Mesh object attributes are added during this
operation. The refine_type must be element. The refine_method must be constant, junction or maxsize. 
The values for /`xvalue/xvalue2/xvalue3`/ should be /-1.,0.,0./. For an element set, use
the shortened syntax refine/element_set/eltset,get,esetname.


The element attributes added to the Mesh object are:

**itetlev** is an integer attribute with the level of refinement. An unrefined mesh element has itetlev(ie)=0, one level of refinement itetlev(ie)=1, etc.


**itetkid** is a pointer to a child element number. If nothing has been done to change element numbering, it is element number of the
 first child element created and the rest of the children are in sequence after the first child. If itetkid(ie)=0 , the element has
 not been refined further.


**itetpar** is a pointer to the parent element at refinement level. itetlev(ie)-1.


Quad meshes will have 4 children for each refined element. Hex meshes will have 8 children. The children are generated sequentially; The
 first child will contain the first local node of the parent element, the other elements are created in the order shown in this diagram.


For example in the picture below, element e1 is refined to create 8 children, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7, c8.

The table gives the octree attribute values for each of the elements.

| Element # | itetlev | itetkid | itetpar |
| :-------: | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| c1|1|0|2|0 |
| c1|2|1|0|1 |
| c2|3|1|0|1 |
| c3|4|1|0|1 |
| c4|5|1|0|1 |
| c5|6|1|0|1 |
| c6|7|1|0|1 |
| c7|8|1|0|1 |
| c8|9|1|0|1 |
 

 One can control refinement so that a hex is broken into either 8, 4 or 2 elements and a quad is broken into either 4 or 2 elements. This is
 controlled with the principal refine direction choice `prd_choice` parameter. This syntax works assuming imt values are greater or equal
 to zero with principal refine direction chosen through a combination of "123" `prd_choice` indicators as defined below. The command line
 used is:

```
 refine/constant/itetclr/linear/element/1,0,0/-1.,0.,0./exclusive/amr prd_choice
```
 or with element selection (based on pset and inclusive/exclusive options):
```
 refine/constant/imt1/linear/element/pset,get,pname/-1.,0.,0./inclusive/ amr prd_choice
```

The parameter `prd_choice` indicates the chosen principal refinement direction based on the local hex element topology as defined by edge numbers,
 for instance, quad edge 1 is in the x direction relative to the local topology.

- **1** refine along x direction, 1 hex-&gt;2 hex, 1 quad-&gt;2 quad (quad edges 1 and 4)
- **2** refine along y direction, 1 hex-&gt;2 hex, 1 quad-&gt;2 quad (quad edges 2 and 3)
- **3** refine along z direction, 1 hex-&gt;2 hex, 1 quad-&gt;4 quad
- **12** refine along x and y direction, 1 hex-&gt;4 hex, 1 quad-&gt;4 quad
- **13** refine along x and z direction, 1 hex-&gt;4 hex, 1 quad-&gt;4 quad
- **23** refine along y and z direction, 1 hex-&gt;4 hex, 1 quad-&gt;4 quad
- **123** refine xyz with prd amr routines, 1 hex-&gt;8 hex, 1 quad-&gt;4 quad
- **0** refine xyz with default amr refinement, 1 hex-&gt;8 hex, 1 quad-&gt;4 quad

## Octree Example with loop

Use a loop to refine up to itetlev = 3 but not 4. This will select elements with itetlev < 3 to refine.

```
* Refine to octree itetlev= 3 elements that are intersected by cmo_3
*
define / CMO_OBJ / cmo_3
define / LEVEL / 3
define / LOOP_MAX / 4
*
loop / do / LOOP_VAR 1 LOOP_MAX 1 / loop_end infile refine_object.mlgi

```


The loop uses this infile refine_object.mlgi
