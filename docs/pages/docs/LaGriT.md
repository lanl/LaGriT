> > **LaGriT** is a library of user callable tools that provide mesh
> > generation, mesh optimization and dynamic mesh maintenance in three
> > dimensions for a variety of applications. Geometric regions within
> > arbitrarily complicated geometries are defined as combinations of
> > bounding surfaces, where the surfaces are described analytically or
> > as collections of points in space. A variety of techniques for
> > distributing points within these geometric regions are provided.
> > Mesh generation uses a Delaunay tetrahedralization algorithm that
> > respects material interfaces and assures that there are no internal
> > negative coupling coefficients. The data structures created to
> > implement this algorithm are compact and powerful and expandable to
> > include hybrid meshes as well as tetrahedral meshes. Mesh refinement
> > and smoothing are available to modify the mesh to provide more
> > resolution in areas of interest. Mesh refinement adds nodes to the
> > mesh based on geometric criteria such as edge length or based on
> > field variable criteria such change in field. Mesh smoothing moves
> > nodes to adapt the mesh to field variable measures, and, at the same
> > time, maintains quality element shape. Mesh elements may become
> > distorted as mesh nodes move during a time dependent simulation or
> > are added as a result of refinement operations. Mesh reconnection
> > via a series of edge flips will maintain the Delaunay criterion of
> > the mesh. An additional requirement of time dependent simulations is
> > that as interface surfaces move, the corresponding region
> > definitions must respond dynamically. As surfaces collide, the mesh
> > must respond by merging points and effectively squeezing out the
> > material between the colliding surfaces. LaGriT provides the
> > necessary tools for time dependent simulations.
