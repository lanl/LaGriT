 Example 6: creatpts in a spherical geometry using shells as region
 boundaries

  The objective is to create a spherical mesh using the
  **createpts/sphere** command.
 
  A spherical geometry is defined containing three regions, each
  defined as the region between two spherical shells. The
  **createpts/sphere/itype=2** command is used to create a point
  distribution between spherical shells for all diamonds of the
  defining icosahedron. The output consists of one gmv file.
